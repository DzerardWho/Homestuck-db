They are making a no8le sacrifice for us all.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #a15000\">TAVROS: (bRAVERY, yEAH, rIGHT,)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #a15000\">TAVROS: (i'M MOSTLY SURE SHE'S MIND CONTROLLING THEM,)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: God DAMMIT, Tavros.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: We really don't need your play 8y play commentary on everything!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: wait, you're mind controlling all those ghosts?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: No!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Well, not all of them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Once you group enough together, others tend to latch on to the mo8 out of curiosity. We trolls have a way of clustering together naturally.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: You've got to understand, John. Most of these people are pretty self a8sor8ed. They just needed a little 8it of persuasion to join the cause.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: word</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: yeah, but...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: isn't that still kind of, um...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: dickish?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: 8ut all these stu88orn jackasses are going to dou8le die anyway if we don't all work together and kill this guy!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: This is WAR, John. In times of war, difficult decisions have to 8e made with the lives of many.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Just think of me as a general giving orders to my troops. It just happens that the orders are a little more direct in this case.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: hey serket deuce</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: lets not lose track a whos actually in charge of this shit mkay</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Yeah yeah.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: All hail Her Imperious Teen Condescension, the fresh new face of tyranny, Supreme Admiral Peixes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: At this time I would like to motion for a fifteen minute 8owing 8r8k so that we may demonstr8te our reverence for this 8old, spunky leader.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: yessssss</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Tavros, stop 8owing.
