And now that mirrored obelisk is good as gone.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I wasn't going to say nothin'.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Hell, I was asleep at the wheel too while you were busy fucking up, and I have an IQ of, hold on, robo-calculating...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Robo-calculating...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Robo-calculating...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Robo-calculating...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Oh brother.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Robo-calculating...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: About 500 billion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: That is really, really robo-smart.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Don't get human-fresh with me, Crocker. I'm about to bring all five hundo-billy points of my stringent cyborg IQ to bear on your dumb problem. Check it out.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I took note of the captcha code to the thing, and recorded a digital flashsnap of its appearance through my photographic silicone memory canals.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Which is to say I looked at eight alphanumeric digits a couple minutes ago, and remembered them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Ok?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: So give the bunny the wallet. I'll have him run back to the house and make you a new obelisk with the same grist you just collected from it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: He can stash it in the wallet and run it back to you, and then you can open the door. You shouldn't be waiting around too long, cause he's real spry.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Which is exactly why you should wait here. You'll just slow him down.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Alright, I think I can do that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: What should I do in the meantime?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Let me think about that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Robo-calculating...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Oh stop it!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: K.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: None of our friends will answer me. What could they be up to?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: You must at least know what Dirk is doing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: He's slicing up some drones.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Some what?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Big red robots. He'll be busy for a while.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Roxy I'm not sure about, but there is a pretty high probability as governed by the immutable laws of mathematics that she is preoccupied similarly.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: She's fighting robots too, you mean?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I don't know. Maybe.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Dealing with them, in some way, perhaps.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: If so, it wouldn't be a coincidence.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Why?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I think the Condesce is attempting to force the issue now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: What? What issue!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: It's likely that it's a coordinated assault. Sending drones both to here and Roxy's place.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: She's probably trying to get everyone else to stop dicking around and join the game already.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Are you sure she's not just trying to kill them?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: It wouldn't be her first assassination attempt.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Yeah, but come on. Dirk has been a sitting duck here for years. Roxy too.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: She could have wiped them out any time with a swarm much bigger than this one. Or just nuked them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Her \"assassination attempt\" on you was pretty weak too.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: But it nearly worked!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I would be dead right now if not for the whims of GCat.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Right.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Like I trust the motives of that fucking thing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: So, you're saying she's only pretending to hunt us?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I believe she probably would genuinely like to kill us. She is a psycho after all.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: But it's also obvious to me she needs us to begin playing this game, for whatever fucked up purpose she has.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: She might even need us to win it too, for all I know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Her antagonism is all part of the dance.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Then you're saying Dirk and Roxy aren't really in danger from the robots?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Oh, I wouldn't say that. They're still pretty deadly and they shoot missiles and stuff.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Augh! I just want to talk to my friends and see if they're ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: What about Jake?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: No idea what's going on with him right now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I'm sure when the time is right, the witch will keep pushing him along to join the game as well.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Then I guess I'll just sit here and worry about everyone quietly until Seb gets back.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: What about your troll friend?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: What?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: The alien whose name you don't know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: You could talk to her.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Oh yeah!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I forgot about her.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: But I suppose that's because she's always the one to contact me. I never get a response when I message her.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Well, you could give her a try. Maybe things are different now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I could hack into her system to get her attention, if you think that would help.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: You can do that??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Nah, just messin' with you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Later.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">timaeusTestified [TT]</span> ceased pestering <span style=\"color: #00d5f2\">gutsyGumshoe [GG]</p>",
