I made sure he was never dou8le-prototyped over the course of the session for this exact reason.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Sometimes it takes a little patience and long range planning to make sure all the loose ends are tied up.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: But.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: Doesnt this mean hes now allergic to himself?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Is he??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I dunno, man.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I never really knew how 8ad his allergies were?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: You know what, whatever. When this is all over, I guess he'll have to deal with a little sneezing now and then, 8ut he'll ALSO have a 8unch of totally sick godlike powers.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: So that's pretty cool, right??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Look kid, you're a little new to the extended scene of everything going on here, 8ut there's kind of 8een a long history of people under-appreci8ting how much shit I do for this guy that looks kinda 8ad 8ut is actually in his 8est interest.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: He'll wake up, acclim8 to his new existence, and when the time comes I'm sure he'll 8e thanking me l8ter.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: I see.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: Hmm yeah when you put it that way...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: I guess youre right.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: Maybe old tavvys actually pretty lucky to have a friend like you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: There you go!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: See Joke? You're a lot smarter than people give you credit for.</span> </p>",
