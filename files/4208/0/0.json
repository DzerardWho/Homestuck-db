Talk about blowing a few measly \"assassination attempts\" way out of proportion!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: So I'm currently mulling over my next move.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: What is it that has you hamstrung? Did you ever track down the slippery Mr. Strider?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Not exactly.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: His stupid doppelglasses have set me on a wild goose chase to go pry his dumb robots chest open and swipe its uranium.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Sounds dangerous!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: No shit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I think id rather deal with the monsters.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Why is it that our two best friends in the world always seem to place themselves at the source of all our problems, while simultaneously presenting their only solutions?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I know right???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I'm debating whether or not to enlist his help in the matter of my current imprisonment. But I'd rather keep it as a plan of last resort.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Dont do it jane its a trap!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: We'll see.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: So I take it you're out and about now?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Hell no. I spent so much time haggling with those confounded shades im only leaving my room just now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Right. Well, not to keep you too long, since we both still have our missions ahead of us, but I wanted to tell you about that dream I had.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh yeah!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I was curious about that. Tell me everything and make it snappy!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: *Whips up bucket of freshly popped corn.*</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Hoo. :B</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Ok, but, I should say that the nature of the dream was a bit worrisome.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: And I'm concerned it may have implications for the game we're about to play.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: So it's probably best that I tell you about it before you leave.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Well shoot.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Ok then lay it on me jane.</p>",
