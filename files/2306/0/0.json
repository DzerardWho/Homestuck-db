If it were drafted by a legitimate contingency firm, it would ostensibly have been given a better title.\r<br/> <br/>Your whole team executes the plan along the course of its journey, employing espionage, mind control tactics, political sabotage, vicious interrogations and cold blooded assassinations. Everyone does their part and you begin to learn the true meaning of teamwork, as well as this troll disease called friendship.</p>",
