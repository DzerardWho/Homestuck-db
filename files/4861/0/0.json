And also uh kind of impossible to understand?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I told roxy i liked it though i didnt want to hurt her feelings so dont say i said that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I think ill wait for the movies to come out i bet ill like those better.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You don't say?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I do say! Hey you mustve seen them what being in the future are they any good?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: They are not.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Phooey to that. Like i even believe you!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: The books are pretty interesting though, if somewhat dense.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: They're supposedly heavily allegorical. Veiled representations of cosmic events surrounding the witch and her boss and how all this came about.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It's the kind of thing you wouldn't pick up on unless you were someone who understood what happened, like the Condesce, which was kind of the point. I think it was her way of letting the witch know, \"I'm on to you.\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: In the early days of the resistance movement they both opposed her more indirectly, through their art, like critics of tyrannical governments often used to.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: They had to be careful. Didn't want to make big waves too early.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: My bro did this too with his many fine films.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Practically everything was a symbol for something. Either in mockery of the batterwitch, or conveying some hidden message to its audience. Each film was always rigorously picked apart for its head-scratching symbolic meaning.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: But he managed to accomplish all that without ever compromising the purity of his ironic vision, which I think was admirable.</p>",
