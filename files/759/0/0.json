Why, the mangrit needed to lift the book is itself a sign of your maturity, not even to speak of the wisdom needed to grasp the nuance of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Sassacre</span>'s time-tested mischief. I am so proud of you, grandson!\r<br/> <br/>How I wish I could have delivered this heirloom to you in the flesh. But I am afraid it wasn't in the cards! For you see, John, like you, this book must yet take a journey! Its journey will end on the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Final Day</span> of my life, and even then will continue some. Though I suppose that will be up to your <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Father</span>. Perhaps he will discuss it with you one day, when he and you are ready.\r<br/> <br/>But it is your journey I am writing about to wish you luck! There will come a day when you will be thrust into another world. And once you arrive, that is only the beginning! You will soon delve even deeper into a realm of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Warring Royalty</span> in a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Timeless Expanse</span>. A realm of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Agents</span> and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Exiles</span> and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Consorts</span> and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Kernelsprites</span>. Of toiling <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Underlings</span> and slumbering <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Denizens</span>. A realm where four will gather, the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Heir of Breath</span> and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Seer of Light</span>, the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Knight of Time</span> and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Witch of Space</span>, and together they will <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Ascend</span>.\r<br/> <br/>John, if only you knew how important you were! I regret my passing came so early in your life. And yet I feel in my heart we have already met. But what I know for sure is that we will meet again! \r<br/> <br/>Until then, John, I do hope your <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Father</span> keeps you well fed!\r<br/> <br/><img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/00759_4under.gif\"/></p>",
