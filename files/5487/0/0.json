But they won't display anything unless they're unlocked.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You unlock them by finding the right keys and using them on that little model of the radio tower next to you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">One of them is unlocked for you already. Can you see it up there?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">YES. YES! I CAN SEE IT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">IT IS A VIEW OF MY DEAD SISTER. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">SHE REALLY MAKES. A MORE BREATHTAKING CORPSE. THAN I EVER IMAGINED.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Whatever you say, weirdo.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Anyway, it's like I said. This is a glorified computer. If you want to change your text color, you can sample some pixels from the display.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">THIS IS PERFECT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">I WAS INTENDING ON USING HER PUTRID GREEN BLOOD. TO COLOR MY TEXT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Were you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">YES. IT WAS GOING TO BE LIKE. PAINTING MY WORDS IN HER BLOOD. AS A TOKEN OF MY RUTHLESS TRIUMPH.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">THEN ON THE NEXT TIME I WAS GOING TO HARASS SOMEBODY. IT WAS GOING TO BE ALL LIKE. LOOK WHO WON. IT'S JUST ME NOW.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">AND I WOULD JUST BE LIKE. NOW WHAT'S UP. *BITCHES*.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">IT WAS GOING TO BE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">SOOOO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">*BAAAAAADASSSS*.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">ALSO. THIS IS A FUNNY COINCIDENCE. BUT I WAS ALSO BATTING AROUND THE IDEA.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">OF STEALING HER BIG U'S ANYWAY?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">I MEAN. AS ANOTHER KIND OF TROPHY. TO LET PEOPLE KNOW. I'M WHOLE. AND THE BEST SIBLING IS IN CHARGE NOW.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">I WAS ON THE FENCE ABOUT DOING THAT THOUGH. BUT I GUESS YOUR STUPID LOCKED KEYBOARD. MAYBE FORCED THE ISSUE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">BUT I'LL JUST SAY BADASSERY WAS THE REASON. AND OMIT THE TEDIOUS ANECDOTE ABOUT THE KEYBOARD.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">SO YEAH.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Then let's consider this a serendipitous facilitation of all your most juvenile typing fantasies.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Let nobody henceforth mistake you for a guy who isn't trying as hard as he can to type like a cold blooded motherfucker.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">YES. THAT'S WHAT I WANT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Great. Now grab that mouse there and pick a new color.</p>",
