Continuing on this path and 8ringing Jade into the game I think you will agree is very important!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: And not just 8ecause she is your friend and you would 8e kind of upset if she died.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Again.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: yes, i think i would be.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: but why else?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ecause you need to complete your prototyping chain!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Only when all players have entered with a prototyped kernel does the 8attlefield assume its final form.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: That form prepares Skaia to grow the new universe you will cre8te.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Or in this case, fail to cre8te. 8ut whatever!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: That is no reason to deter you from completing worthwhile game o8jectives.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: we are supposed to create a universe?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yeah! You didn't realize that yet?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: no!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8oy. How clueless can you get.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: why are we supposed to do that?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: What a stupid question! It is the point of the game. It's what happens when you win, and winning is the only point of anything.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: oh. that's true, i guess.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Anyway, you should 8e glad it's the point. And you should 8e glad your predecessors were not such a sad sack group of players like you guys.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Otherwise your universe would not exist, seeing as we cre8ted it 8y 8eing incredi8le in every way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: you did?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yep. You're welcome. ::::D</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: hmm...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i don't know what to think about that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Not knowing what to think a8out things appears to 8e your specialty!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: hurrrrr oh man what a burn!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: (j/k it was actually lame.)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: ::::P</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: well to be honest, i never really believed any of your guys's doom and gloom nonsense.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: not because i think you are lying...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i just feel like there must still be a way to win!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: That's the spirit, John!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: That is a winner's attitude, and there is always hope for someone who has that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: yes, i agree.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: also, there is always hope for someone who has good friends to count on!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Pff.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Laaaaaaaame.</p>",
