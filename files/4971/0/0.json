HALF. NO WE DID MOST OF THEM DIDN'T WE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: No, we did three, and there are three possible matchups left.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Don't you know anything about shipping science?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">uu: THAT'S A THING?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">uu: HOW THE FuCK COuLD THAT BE A THING.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Believe me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It's a thing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Total number of pairings for a group of n people is (n^2 - n) / 2.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You divide by 2 to cut the grid in half, eliminate duplicate pairs.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Minus n is so you don't pair people up with themselves. That wouldn't make sense.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">uu: AND WHY THE FuCK NOT??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Well, because...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I don't know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Maybe you're right.
