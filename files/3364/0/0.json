Under other circumstances, the aroma could be delightful. A rich chocolatey bouquet, sent from the heavens.\r<br/> <br/>But at the scene of this fresh murder, the smell is highly unpalatable.

And if there's one thing that matters even more than the truth, which there is, it's justice. Someone is going to pay.</p>",
