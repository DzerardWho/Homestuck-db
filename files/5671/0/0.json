And maybe thats why i always seem to be botching things up the wazoo with my pals.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Maybe thats why i feel like such a loner. I dunno. Im rambling and ive been thinking about it a lot lately. What about you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Does being special make you screw the pooch with your friends like it does for me?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: UGH. NO. I DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: FOR MY PEOPLE. THE WORD FOR FRIENDS. IS FLAWS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Wow really?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: PROBABLY NOT? BUT. IT SHOULD BE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: BECAUSE IT'S TRUE. AS A MATTER OF MY PERFECT PHILOSOPHY ABOUT EVERYTHING.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: BUT THE FACT THAT YOU CLEARLY HATE YOUR FRIENDS. AND ARE READY TO SHED THEM LIKE THE DRY SKIN OF A SERPENT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: INDICATES THAT WE SHARE A VERY SPECIAL QUALITY AMONG BROTHERLY BROS. WHO MUST WORK HARDER WITH OUR BRAINS THAN EVERYONE ELSE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: SO WE MAY ACHIEVE BRUTAL SUPREMACY OVER THEM ALL.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Haha. Well i wouldnt go that far. I love my friends!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: But i was once told i had a lot of potential.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Supposedly thats how all pages are and it takes them for frickin EVER to reach it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: And funnily enough it was a figment of my own subconscious that told me this. A part of my untapped potential itself! But disguised as my best bro which was...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Peculiar to say the least.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Is that your situation? Are you a page too?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: HELL NO. BUT THANKS FOR THE LAUGH.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: MY CLASS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOURS. IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY. EVEN THOUGH I JUST LAUGHED.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: MINE IS THE BEST OF ALL. WHILE YOURS IS FUCKING TRASH.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh? Whats yours then?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: LORD.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Fine then jeez.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Sorry for asking!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: WHAT?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: NO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: THAT WAS NOT A SHORT REMARK OF FRUSTRATION.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: IT WAS THE ANSWER DUMBASS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: IT'S THE MASTER CLASS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: DON'T YOU LOSERS DO ANY HOMEWORK ON THIS GAME.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: YOU'D THINK YOU WOULD ALL BE EXPERTS. WITH HOW MUCH MY SISTER HARANGUED YOU ON THIS TEDIOUS SHIT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: SINCE I HAVE HAD GREAT SUCCESS SO FAR. IN PROGRESSING THROUGH THIS DEAD SESSION. I DECIDED. IT WAS TIME TO BITE THAT BULLET.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: AND RETURN HOME. TO RETRIEVE ALL OF HER TERRIBLE TEXTS ON THE SUBJECT OF THIS GAME. AND OF YOUR STORY.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: I HAVE PORED OVER EVERY NAUSEATING VERSE. IT HAS BEEN A TRUE EXERCISE IN AGONY. FEW COULD POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND MY SUFFERING.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: BUT THAT'S OK.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: BECAUSE I'M NOT THE IDIOT KID I USED TO BE. NOW I KNOW. THAT WHAT IT TAKES FOR ME TO LEARN AND GROW STRONGER.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: IS EXCRUCIATING EFFORT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: SO I HAVE A CHOICE. WHICH IS TO EITHER BE WEAK.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: WHEN WEAKNESS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: OR TO SUFFER. FOREVER. UNTIL NO ONE ELSE EXISTS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: WHO IS STRONGER THAN ME.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: AND THAT'S YOUR CHOICE TOO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: PAGE HUMAN ENGLISH.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Sakes alive.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: That is a bit extreme no?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: FOR YOU. PROBABLY EVEN MORE SO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: BECAUSE AS A LOWLY PAGE. AND AS AN EVEN LOWLIER HUMAN. YOU ARE UTTERLY WORTHLESS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: AND SO YOUR TRIALS I BELIEVE MUST INCLUDE. PROVING TO PARADOX SPACE THAT YOU EVEN DESERVE TO EXIST. IN THE FIRST PLACE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: AND WHILE MY TRIALS WILL BE SIMILARLY GRUELING. A LORD'S WORTHINESS IS AT NO POINT EVER IN DOUBT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: HIS NOBILITY IS MANIFEST. SUPREME MASTERY WAITS FOR HIM PATIENTLY. LIKE AN EMPTY THRONE UNDER HEAVY GUARD.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: REALITY ALREADY KNOWS I WILL PREVAIL. JUST AS IT KNEW I WOULD PREDOMINATE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: AND SO INEVITABILITY IS ALWAYS ON MY SIDE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: IT IS MY. WHAT DO YOU CALL IT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: BORTHRIGHT?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: BORTHRIGHT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I dont think thats a word.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: But hey you are the lord and i am the lowly page.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: DAMN STRAIGHT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">uu: NEVER FORGET WHO YOU ARE MEANT TO SERVE.</p>",
