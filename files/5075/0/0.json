MY \"BIRTH DAY THANK YOu GIFT\"??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: That's not a thing either.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You must have some wires crossed between your left brain and right brain. Like a weird perceptual disorder. Or something like that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It's actually kind of fascinating that you think you achieved something visually coherent or recognizable.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">uu: THIS IS OuTRAGEOuS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Anyway. Got to go.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Your drawing blows.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Later.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">timaeusTestified [TT]</span> ceased pestering <span style=\"color: #323232\">undyingUmbrage [uu]</p>",
