So smooth and stylish!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I forgot how much I loved highlighting it to read all the 8oring things you have to say.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: It's like a fun game for super extra handicapped retarded people. Like opening a present! Find out what o8noxious thing the mystery tool typed.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: What is it!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">A parting courtesy, I suppose.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">All the ways I've exploited you were meant to bring about the events that will take place this evening.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">Knowing this will provide context for the events in your near future, and will affect how you behave in response.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">These events will be just as important as those preceding it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">I've gone to great lengths, you see.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: You didn't exploit me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: You are just a petty douche with a 8ad temper who likes to pl8y g8mes, and all I did w8s humor you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">I did exploit you, very thoroughly. It was easy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: So full of yourself!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">Have I ever lost a game?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Don't ch8nge the su8ject!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">What subject are you referring to?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: XXXXO</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I'm going to log off in a 8ig huff and you have to promise not to use that nasty trick where you log me 8ack on out of petty douchey spite!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: And then we can go 8ack to never ever talking, 8ecause man! That was heaven when it was like th8t!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">There's no need for that kind of assurance.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">I'll be brief.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">I no longer hold you accountable for any wrongdoing. In fact, I've given your transgression very little thought since the incident.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">If you acknowledge this amnesty and regard it as sincere, you may begin to find the odds falling in your favor again.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">This may be essential if you are to succeed on your journey.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Mm hmm. Slow down! Man.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I am just wearing out so many pens taking all these important notes! Fuuuuuuuuck!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Fuck you for ruining all my good note-taking pens and giving me this terri8le cramp in my good note-taking hand!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">Incredible, the risks you take with your scorn.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">But of course it was your unpleasant, simplistic temperament that made you so easy to control.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">Vicious and predictable, like an insect.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">If you turn a swarm of wasps on a crowd, the outcome is certain.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">It takes no skilled strategist to understand this. You were in fact a waste of my talents.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">A primitive expedient.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Blech. What a sno8. You're worse than my meddley meddler meddlefriend.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">I wonder why they waste their camaraderie on you. I'll never understand it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I thought you said you would 8e 8rief????????</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">I'll say one last thing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">Though the magnitude of the ensuing destruction resulting directly from your actions will be neither possible or necessary for you to fathom, there nevertheless ought to be a silver lining.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">The only question is whether you will live long enough to see it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">I'm not a gambling man.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">But if I was, I wouldn't bet on it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">Goodbye.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Zzzzzzzz. 8ye, assh8le.</p>",
