She's sort of an x-factor.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: It's hard to accur8tely gauge her threat level, 8ut I'm not a8out to take any chances.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: All these threats are just outside the incipisphere, en route to the session as we speak.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Once they arrive, all hell will 8reak loose. That's when endgame is officially go.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: You only have a couple hours to prepare, so you need to listen to every word I say.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Victory will depend on following my plan to the letter!</p>",
