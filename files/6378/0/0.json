<img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> Just enjoying the good life</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> One which quite lu%uriously involves both having a corporeal body, and not being dead</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> I have been delighting myself with some truly kickbottom internal monodialogues</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> Did you know that, even though technically I knew this already, I find myself astounded to meditate upon the fact that human beings are capable of lactation?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> Isn't that <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arspritetxt_fucking.gif\"/> incredible, Dirk?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> I mean, when one really thinks about it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> To have such convenient access to fresh milk</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> The mare thought of it, I must say puts a little giddyup in my phantom legs</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> And yet</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> I must admit the notion of lactic discharge jetting from one's swollen pectoral masses...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> It strikes me as positively indecorous</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> My horseguy robosweat is running cold just pondering the depravity of it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Uuuugh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> Yet fascinatingly, this ability only manifests itself in human females</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> As opposed to how one would reasonably e%pect dairy to originate, which is from the corpulent udder of a sublimely chiseled male musclebeast</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> Or failing that, certain species found within the butler genus</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> As a former simulation of a human who has recently been given reason to have hella opinions on milk production, I think the way females have cornered this boon is the height of biological injustice</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> Have you ever dwelt upon this cruelty, dude esquire?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: </p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> Your silence speaks volumes to your interest, so I'll keep talking about this a lot</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> I will have to confess that my Alternian half boggles at the anatomical incongruities between our races with respect to dairy secretion</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> Really, he had no idea that's what those were for</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> Female trolls of course have them as well, but they are certainly not meant for supplying the young with nourishment</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> Actually, and this trivia will surely wet your whistle for additional such facts, those voluptuous anatomical features have a number of significant purposes, biologically speaking</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> I shall now e%plicate for you these purposes in assiduous detail</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: I don't want to hear any of this!</p>",
