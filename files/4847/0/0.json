He is perfect.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh shoot dirk he just got blurry and disappeared! What the actual fuck?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Don't worry, that's normal.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Upon activation he goes into Stalking Mode.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Stalking mode??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Yes. He will stalk you in the jungle and strike when your guard is down.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: What? Thats crazy why would i want that!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Didn't you want someone to get in scrums with?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Well yeah but... man.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: He will give you all the scrums you can handle. Trust me, this will sharpen your combat skills.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I guess youre right.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I was just picturing a little good honest rough housing... why does the whole thing have to sound so sketchy and nerve wracking!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Do you want to hear my grim tales of the apocalypse or not?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Yes!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Youre right lets put issues of fisticuffs aside for now. Tell me everything about the future.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: So how does humanity fuck up? Is it the nuclear holocaust? Or is it robots? Gotta be the robots right? As per the terminator.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: No, it's more of a gradual decline in population than that, due to an insidious power grab by an aquatic alien empress.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh the old alien overlord story? Got it. When does she show up?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: She's already there, in your time period, hiding in plain sight. She has been for anywhere between fifty and a hundred years.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: She's the Baroness of Crockercorp. Jane's company. But of course Jane has no idea.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: The Baroness has been using subtle strategies to manipulate the human population through her company for a long time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: On November 11th, 2011, she finally made her presence known to the world, along with her agenda for global domination.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Jeez that is pretty scary. So in a few years she will be in charge of everything?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: No, not quite. That's just when the world finally sees her for the threat she is. She would continue to gain power by exploiting various institutions and the media from within.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It would take the next several decades for her to claim the throne as Earth's absolute ruler. Her march to domination was facilitated by a number of scumbag sympathizers, and opposed by a few brave rebels, including my ancestor. Roxy's too.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I think your ancestor qualifies as one too. In fact I'm sure she must have been the first member of the covert opposition movement.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: My grandma?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I do remember when i was very young she would tell me stories of the wicked woman who raised her.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Was she the evil alien?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Yep.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: That's a whole story right there, most of which is shrouded in rumor and urban legend.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: But before we get sidetracked by any of that, I'll try to cover the big picture. To give you a sense of all the batshit lunacy that followed the sea hag's power play.</p>",
