What have you read, and what do you remember?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: My memory of her is pretty foggy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I do know she loved adventure just like me. Thats why she was exploring this island and raising me here when she died.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: She was a fair markswoman and knew her way around an atom or two.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Pretty sure her company made a tidy fortune til it went belly up. At least i still have a few of her knickknacks for keepsakes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: And as you confirmed she was raised by that evil spinster.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: But then again from some of the things my pen pal has said it kind of throws some of these details into question so i dunno what to think.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I don't know what the deal is with your pen pal either, and I'm not really prepared to speculate on that right now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: But I'm privy to a shitload of historical data I can share. What's the last thing you remember about her?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: It was the night i found her dead!</p>",
