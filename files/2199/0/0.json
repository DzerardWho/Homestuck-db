In ancient times such weapons were employed by roving bands of GAMBLIGNANTS, deadly marauders with a passion for chance. They all died off though. Took too many crazy risks.\r<br/> <br/>Rolling the dice will execute a wide range of highly unpredictable attacks. Very high rolls can be devastating to even the most powerful opponents.\r<br/> <br/>Of course with the luck you've had lately, you couldn't make a good roll to save your life. Got to do something about this awful luck.\r<br/> <br/>Gotta catch a br8k!!!!!!!!\r<br/> <br/>When you get worked up about stuff you put 8's in places that don't really make a lot of sense phonetically.</p>",
