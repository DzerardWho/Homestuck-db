I keep trying to tell you, and it's starting to get frustr8ing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: i see. so it is not me who is jodie foster. it's more like you are jodie, because nobody believed her when she came home and had amazing tales to tell.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: except matthew mcconaughey.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Aaaaaaaargh!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: but it's ok. i will be your matt mcconaughey.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Does that mean you'll 8elieve me now?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: i guess i always did, sort of.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: i think i've been in denial about what's happening here.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: It's nice that you 8elieve me. 8ut that doesn't mean you remem8er yet.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: so if this isn't my dad, then where is he?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: He died too. You saw his 8ody. Don't you at least remem8er that?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: no. not at all.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: i am remembering a bunch of things, but not that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Then what?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Do you remem8er me yet?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: no.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: i only remember when you contacted me and said you'd kill me a little earlier.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: but that was months ago.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: i do remember talking to some other trolls like you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: and playing this game. it was on my 13th birthday. i was really looking forward to playing it, but it was late in the mail.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: i got some presents from my dad. like this big weird clown doll that i didn't like much.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: and some fruit gushers...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: oh yeah! i also realized gushers were made by betty crocker. that freaked me the fuck out!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: did YOU realize betty crocker makes gushers???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: This comes as news to me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: well she does. her villainy knows no bounds.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: oh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: he also gave me this suit, which i remember wearing for a while.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: but it didn't look quite like this.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: it had a black tie, and no ghost, so i improved it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: actually...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: i remember dying in a suit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: You do?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: but</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: this was not the suit i was wearing when i died.</p>",
