There's not a lot of style to invisibility. Primarily because nobody gets to see how damn smooth you're being.\r<br/> <br/>It's kind of a pointless power anyway. Some real dimestore parlor trickery that's just a waste of everyone's time. You doubt you'll ever use it again. It's sure not going to help you track down that elusive kid.\r<br/> <br/>But sooner or later he's going to find out it's much harder to outrun the ring's true power.</p>",
