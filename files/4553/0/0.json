Factoring contingencies. You know how it is.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: It seems to me you were dwelling within your dream awareness at the expense of your waking business again.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I don't think you're as awesome a multi-tasker as you like to think. You know you kind of zombie the fuck out on this side when you get all contemplative on that side.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Appearances are deceptive.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I'm still in control here. Just doing this human thing we call \"chilling out for half a goddamn minute.\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I say y'all are overestimating your mind's capability to run shit in parallel.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: What do you think you are? A machine?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: No dude.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I already deployed a variety of mechanical avatars dedicated to that self-aggrandizing fantasy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You have the incredible privilege of getting to be one of them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: That's right. I am a machine, and therefore I can keep like billions of calculations or whatever all humming away at once.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I tackle shit in background processes that you could only dream of wrapping your exquisite looking head around, even on a great hair day.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: You know pi?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: What, you mean the number?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Yes, the number. The big circle number, genius.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I knew you meant the fucking number, my question was a joke.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I know your question was a joke, my response was a joke.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Yeah, I know that. I'm practically you, dumbass. All these things we're saying are jokes, including this fuckin' useless clarification.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: What about pi?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Yeah, the thing is, I solved it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: What do you mean you solved it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I mean that's what a hotshot I am. I fuckin' solved it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Like, calculated it so much, I got to the end.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Bullshit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: You wish it was bullshit. The last number is 4. Read it and fucking weep.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It's not 4 you jackass, it's fucking nothing. There is no end.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Said the smug organic matter with a lifespan.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Look, I know you're just fucking with me because for some reason I decided to program my own personal troll three years ago, but this shit was proven.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Actually demonstrated with unassailable mathematics, like a long ass time ago.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Well, I just assailed it. It wasn't even that hard.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Like I just kept hacking those digits so furiously with my sick 'rithms, the whole goddamn number just cried uncle.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I kind of wore it out, and it just gave up. Sort of like I overloaded the system.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: You know like in the old movie when Ferris Bueller got the nuclear computer to play tic-tac-toe against itself so hard, it blew up?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: This is laughable. It's a totally elementary thing. I'm pretty sure an ancient Greek guy settled shit about irrational numbers. It was practically when math was invented.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Sure, it was settled, and then some roboshades came along and owned that fucker posthumously.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I also figured out all the prime numbers too.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: No, not having this conversation.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Did it while we were talking just now. Got to the end.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: And you know what? The last one isn't even that big. Kinda dissapointed, to be honest.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: What is even a prime number?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Are they the, like... really, really choice ones? The sweetest numbers?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You lost me, supercomputer.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: This is what I'm saying. I put your ability to keep plates spinnin' on sticks to insane amounts of shame.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I don't even sleep.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Neither do I.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I know that, that was the fucking joke.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Holy shit, turns out joking was the basis for my response too.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Aren't these ironic \"you don't get the joke\" conversations we have always just so awesome? &lt;- A joke.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Ha ha, nice one.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Anyway, all I'm saying is you can leave some of the heavy lifting to me now and then.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I'll keep that in mind.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: In the meantime, I have to contact Jane and warn her Roxy might try to pull that pointless stunt.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: So, thanks for snapping me out of my daydream so I could do that, I guess?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Looks like you're pulling your weight already.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: See? Maybe that was my whole point in having this conversation.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Your point was to fuck with me, like it usually is.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: My point was to point out you've got multi-self management issues, dude.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Jugglin' too many selves for being not-software.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: My point was also to fuck with you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Also,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: My point was to ask,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Are you really going to go through with it today?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: What?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: The Jake thing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Oh god.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Will you just,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Hold on.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Let me deal with the Jane thing first.</p>",
