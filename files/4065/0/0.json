Her ship now travels near the speed of light, a pale shadow of its former velocity. It would take her another 612 solar sweeps after the Glub to reach her destination.\r<br/> <br/>She should arrive any minute now. When she does, she will find nothing but ruins and dust.

But whether she looks or not, one thing will find her with certainty.\r<br/> <br/>A new employment opportunity.</p>",
