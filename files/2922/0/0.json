do you know everything?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I didn't know why you were asleep, did I?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: yeah, but...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: neither did i!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I have more pedestrian sources too, you know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Sometimes trolls blither tidbits about the future, and I can't help but take note of it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Just as they do with you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: You also have access to the oracle clouds in Skaia, whereas I do not.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: oh yeah.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Knowing the future is no remarkable feat here.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It appears to be a fact of life.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I'm not all that special, John.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: ok, buuuuuut...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i guess that's not all i'm talking about.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: you seem a little different.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: kind of, um... spooky?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Really?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i just mean that before, it felt like we were in this adventure together, figuring stuff out as we went along.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: and now you have all the answers! because of magic, and other mysterious reasons!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: and you want to use your powers to break the game, and i still don't really understand why, and...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: bluh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I'm not actually trying to caricaturize a grim sorcerer.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: There's still a perfectly intact piece of my mind which realizes how ridiculous it is to be flying across rainbow oceans with a couple of magic wands and a salamander in a little cowl.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: And it wasn't without swallowing a little embarrassment that I revealed I was using a crystal ball just now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It's all pretty absurd.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: And yet,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It's been fun, and above all, practical.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: For solving our problems.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: ok, yeah, you're right.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i guess i just started worryin'...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: that you are getting away from us!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: because you know everything, and you're magic, and you have a crystal ball, and a salamander, and you are basically a wizard.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: and that's cool, and it sure does sound fun...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: but i kinda think it was more fun when you just did things like read books, and tell jokes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I still read books and tell jokes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: BA-DUM PSHHH!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: John,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: That was mean.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: sorry. :(</p>",
