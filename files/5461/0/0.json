That plastered floozy is spouting her nonsense again. It looks like your sister told the human her name? That is a clear and egregious violation of the rules. She must have been getting really desperate. \r<br/> <br/>The joke is on the human though. She's trying to wake up a dead girl.\r<br/> <br/>It seems their session is still completely blacked out. What a bummer. Where's the fun in harassing these losers when you can't see them?\r<br/> <br/>Maybe it's time you left them all behind anyway. You don't have the patience for games with idiots anymore. There are much bigger things on the horizon for you. </p>",
