I'll have to leave again shortly.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It looks like there's another large meteor headed for...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: My present location.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: oh, so you mean dave connected with you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Not yet.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I'll explain later.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: But I think I've determined that activating the timer in the game is not directly responsible for summoning a meteor to your location.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: The countdown seems merely to exist as a kind of warning to the player.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: As well as a strange coincidence.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: um, ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i don't really think i get it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: is this relevant?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Probably not at the moment. And certainly not to you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I have to go.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: ok, later!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: P.S. Try not to waste too much of that grist while I'm gone.</p>",
