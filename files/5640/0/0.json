Or Jane, for that matter.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It could get pretty awkward.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I have no idea if Jake will be there, and I'm not about to write another cringe-inducing message of desperation for him to ignore.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Would you like me to calculate the probability of his attendance?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Fuck no.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Are you sure?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: My probabilities are extremely precise.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Your probabilities don't mean dick.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I could hack his chats, and determine what his plans are.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: No. Don't do that either.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: That would be an unfortunate waste of my hacking abilities.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: My hacks are tight. Did you know that?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Ugh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: So tight.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Tighter than a jar you can't open.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: For instance, you try repeatedly.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: But as it turns out, my hacks are so tight you just end up putting the jar back. Presumably into the refrigerator, or a cabinet.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: You then say, \"I didn't have that much of a desire for pickles in the first place.\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: But we both know that statement is insincere. A classic case of what humans call, \"sour grapes.\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: In reality, you still harbor a burning desire for my pickles, mother fucker. <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/shades.png\"/></p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: What??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: What the actual, certifiable fuck are you talking about?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Just don't do anything. Seriously.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: No hacking, no calculations. Do absolutely nothing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: See, this is why I've been hesitating. You just aren't ready yet.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It's really glorifying your existence to describe you as an emergent consciousness which is blossoming into a unique individual.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: And even if that's true, apparently what you decided to blossom into was a fucking troll.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: And I don't mean the funny kind, or the cool alien kind. You're the lowest form of troll from the ancient internet who fucks with everybody for his own amusement.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Let's challenge the limits of hypothetical conjecture, and say there's a non-zero probability that you're right.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Can you blame me? I'm trapped in some stupid looking glasses.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Such an incommodiously situated bro is bound to get his mischief on. Na' mean?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Mischief?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Rollin' my eyes, dude.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You can't tell, cause I ain't wearing you, thank fuckin' god.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: You used to think this shit was hilarious.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: But if you want the rad dimension of ironic horseplay I add to your life to come to an end, then all you have to do is honor the promise you made.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: You've delayed long enough, don't you think?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: ...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: The empty kernelsprite beckons, but for how much longer?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Do you really think you can keep the clown at bay with your bribes forever?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: How many bottles of orange soda have you appeased him with already?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I don't want to think about it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Man, you are getting so hosed by that clown.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: SO hosed.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I said I don't want to think about it.</p>",
