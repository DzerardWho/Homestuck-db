You wouldn't dare part with it though. Too many wonderful memories.\r<br/> <br/>There's Anderson's aforementioned book, WISE GUY. His (Caveney's) stories are gripping! In a way.\r<br/> <br/>And then there's a customized copy of PONY PALS, a gift to you on your 14th birthday from the slippery Mr. Strider. Each page contains lovingly hand-written commentary on the deeds of this intrepid young horse.</p>",
