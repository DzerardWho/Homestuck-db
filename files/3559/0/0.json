There's a narrow line to walk between obeying the orders of a clear superior and blindly facilitating a  perfectly useless genocide. It takes a very savvy breed of psychopath to pull it off.\r<br/> <br/>The Slayer is yapping about some girl. Probably one of the young players who can no longer provide any serious threat to your rule. But he wants you to go kill her anyway. You ask why he doesn't go kill her himself. He says it's complicated. This guy, you swear. You tell him you're busy with things that actually matter. Like running this kingdom on his behalf and all. Levying taxes, oppressing consorts, all the unpleasant chores he would never dirty his snout with. He says this is more important than any of that stuff. You say fine, just send the droll after her. \r<br/> <br/>There's a moment of radio silence. \r<br/> <br/>He says you mean the COURTYARD Droll? He wants to be sure this is the same droll you're talking about. You say yeah, what's the problem? He says, you mean the very same droll who couldn't manage the one simple task assigned to him, to steal the White Queen's ring from the very same adoring, wonderful girl and master and friend in question? Wait. He says he just means girl. Just girl. You didn't hear any of that.\r<br/> <br/>You don't say anything.\r<br/> <br/>He says fine. You win. Sic the stupid droll on her, what does he care. </p>",
