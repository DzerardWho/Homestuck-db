THE CAPS LOCK KEY APPEARS TO BE PERMANENTLY DEPRESSED.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">HOW DO I MAKE IT NOT LIKE THAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">It's locked.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You need a key to unlock it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You need keys to unlock a whole bunch of features on this tower.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">WHERE IS THE KEY.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">How should I know???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">BECAUSE YOU ARE AN INFURIATING FONT OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT MANY THINGS. INCLUDING MY OWN BRAIN BEHAVIORS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Why should I tell you everything?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Find your own fucking keys. It's your quest, remember?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">NO, BUT TYPING LIKE THIS IS BAD.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">IT'S REALLY THROWING ME OFF.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I don't understand the problem.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">I CAN'T MAKE MY U'S LITTLE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">No, I got that. But caps lock should make it easier.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You do realize when caps lock is on, you can hold down shift to make letters lower case, right?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">WHAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">NO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">I DON'T USE CAPS LOCK. I THOUGHT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE A TRAINING KEY FOR RETARDS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">A training key?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">MAYBE ALSO FOR GIRLS. FOR WHEN THEY GET HYSTERICAL AND MAKE THEIR LETTERS SHOUT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Ok, got it. Really great theories there.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">So... how do you usually type then?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">JUST. NEVER MIND.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Hang on. Are you saying you hold down shift with one hand, while hunting and pecking for all the letters with the other?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">And whenever you type a 'u' you just let go of shift??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">I SAID NEVER MIND.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Wow.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">OK LOOK.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">I CAN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE METHOD YOU PROPOSED IS A LOT MORE EFFICIENT AND SENSIBLE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">I JUST HAVE MY OWN STYLE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">THAT I'M COMFORTABLE WITH.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">AND ALSO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">I JUST NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">How old were you again?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">FUCK YOU.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">OK, THE THING IS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">DON'T TELL ANYBODY I SAID THIS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">BUT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">I'VE ALWAYS HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">AT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">LEARNING STUFF.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yeah.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I know.</p>",
