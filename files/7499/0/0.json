Jape?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: Ja...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: I</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: J...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: Yes. Sure.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">TAVROSPRITE: nO, iT'S NOT jAPE, wRONG,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Who even cares? Your overly simplistic human names all sound so alike to me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Anyway, listen Jape.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Whatever load of shit he's selling you in a misguided effort to cheer you up, don't listen to him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: It's all a 8unch of sappy delusional gar8age.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I'm not going to let you down easy, and some day you'll realize this is the 8iggest favor anyone's ever done for you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: You are never going to do anything important, and you'll never amount to anything. Period!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Neither is Tavros.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">TAVROSPRITE: wAIT, nO, nOW HOLD, ON,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: No, YOU hold on, Tavros.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: You had more than enough chances to prove you could 8e a relevant contri8utor to our adventure, 8ut you 8lew it every step of the way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: It's time to face the facts. You're never going to have that \"8ig moment\" that vindic8tes your arc of personal development. It's just not going to happen!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">TAVROSPRITE: nO, i KNOW THAT, i JUST ADMITTED THAT,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">TAVROSPRITE: yOU WEREN'T LISTENING TO OUR,,,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: It's not going to happen for Jape here, either. So stop filling his head with nonsense.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I can just smell it off him. He's just like you, really.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: A loser is a loser.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: *Sniffle.*</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Here's the 8ottom line.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Pages just suck!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: All of them do. They just can't ever seem to get it together.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I think it just happens to 8e the class players get stuck with if they're naturally that sort of person.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: It doesn't mean they don't have value as people, 8ut they'll never have anything significant to contri8ute, so they really should just stay out of the way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: There's a certain quiet dignity in understanding your utterly cripplng limit8tions as an individual. Ideally, a VERY quiet dignity, so the important people can still hear themselves think!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">TAVROSPRITE: oK BUT, wHAT ABOUT ALL THAT, bIG PAGE POTENTIAL,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: That's also a lot of misleading horseshit, and really kind of a cruel stipul8tion of the class, to 8e honest.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: It makes losers think there's actually some light at the end of a long tunnel, so it keeps them dreaming instead of facing the facts!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Sure, they could reach all that potential if they worked really hard for a long time, 8ut don't you get it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: The very n8ture of who they are PROHI8ITS that! They don't have what it takes to stick it out to the end, 8ecause they're too weak mentally.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: So it's just the game playing a nasty joke on them. Like dangling a carrot at the end of a ridiculously long stick.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Only an asshole would knowlingly play along with such a vicious hoax.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">TAVROSPRITE: aRGH, nO, aNY FORM OF FRIENDSHIP ENCOURAGEMENT, nO MATTER WHAT, iS UNIVERSALLY GREAT i THINK,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">TAVROSPRITE: wE ALL LEARN THIS AS FACT, fROM LOTS OF THINGS WE SEE AND ENJOY, iN STORIES AND STUFF,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Oh my fucking god.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: No... tavrosprite shes... shes right.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: Shes right.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: *Sniff.*</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">TAVROSPRITE: vRISKA, lOOK AT WHAT YOU DID,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">TAVROSPRITE: yOU MADE MY FRIEND JAPE SAD,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">TAVROSPRITE: dON'T LISTEN TO HER, aND COME HERE BUDDY, fOR A REASSURING EMBRACE,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: TAVROS DON'T YOU FUCKING TOUCH HIM!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Remem8er, you've only 8een prototyped once!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Do you REALLY want to fuse into an eternal monstrosity with that weenie?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: God, what a weenie singularity that would 8e. May8e I should stand 8ack and let it happen!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: For science. Also, it would serve you right.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">TAVROSPRITE: oHHHHHHHH,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">TAVROSPRITE: yEAHHHHHHHH?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">TAVROSPRITE: wELL GET A LOAD, oF THIS!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">TAVROSPRITE: aCTUALLY,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">TAVROSPRITE: nO, yOU'RE,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">TAVROSPRITE: rIGHT OF COURSE, i WON'T HUG HIM, bECAUSE,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">TAVROSPRITE: tHAT SOUNDS REALLY, rEALLY BAD,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">TAVROSPRITE: sORRY JAPE,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: :(</p>",
