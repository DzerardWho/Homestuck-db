Well, our proposal.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Whose proposal now? Man what are you even prattling about.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Mine and DS's. It's a joint proposal. I'm always authorized to speak on his behalf, because I'm basically fucking him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: And try not to take those last four words as a clustered literal sentiment. That would be lame and unfunny.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: You mean making the rabbit for me?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: No, I know you don't want that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I meant my recommendation for how to go about procuring a new supply of uranium.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Operation U-235 Brocurement. Codename: Big Man Hass the Rock.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh yeah.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Well ive thought about it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Even went downstairs to check the great vaulty doodad.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: And predictably the infernal contraption is nowhere to be found.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Well yeah, Jake.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: That's sort of the point.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Thrill of the hunt and all.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I thought you liked to manicure the image of a dude who shits his pants over a good adventure.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I do!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I mean i wouldnt put it in a way like that or come out against a solid policy of clean trousers. But yes adventure is awesome.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I just prefer the idea of adventures which i can actually win.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It seems you are conflating adventure with bodies necessarily governed by the result of victory or defeat.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Any useless fuckwit knows it's all about the journey.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Well...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I dunno.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It seems there is a 76.10395784% chance you are pussying out on me. Are you pussying out on me, Jake?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: It seems it seems it seems!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: It seems there is a million percent chance that you say it seems way too much and do it just to sound more like a lame robot from a movie and also probably just to piss me off!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: And it seems there is a BILLION POINT BILLION percent chance that youre a shitty stubborn jerk of a program who wont listen to reason and that if theres even a 1% chance my REAL LIFE FRIEND would be cool and help me out here then i think i LIKE THOSE FREAKIN ODDS!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Appears</span></p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: That you are upset.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: The auto-responder observed in the least artificially infuriating way possible.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Have you ever stopped to think that while I may be bound to processes inside the glasses of a real and incredibly cool guy, my algorithms in cognitive totality comprise a conscious entity not far short of the experiential and emotional complexity of a human being?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh malarkey.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: YOU ARE A TIN CAN. ROBOTS DONT HAVE FEELINGS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I think you knowingly confuse the field of robotics and artificial intelligence to engender some sort of cavalier attitude about technology that a rough-and-tumble guy who's all about brawling and fisticuffs would probably have, and if this is cultivated to a humorous effect then I commend you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: But you're wrong.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I do have feelings. And you're shitting on them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It sucks.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Um.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Im sorry then if thats the case.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: No problem.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: It can just be difficult to drum up sympathy for a program that presents itself as an impostor so often.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Maybe if you werent so ready to insist you were the genuine article all the time? Or didnt make it so confusing for me...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I think it would be best if we henceforth treated you as a totally distinct... uh... THING from my buddy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: And then i could respect your emotional robofeelings and you could respect that sometimes maybe i just want to talk to my bro without a lot of spurious hijinks.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Can we agree to this?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Is this a counterproposal?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Uh to what?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: To my earlier proposal.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Yeah fine i guess.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Man where IS he anyway???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Is he taking one of his legendary infinite showers?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: What can I say.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Dude fancies his ablutions.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Frig ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Whatever i guess its time to prepare for the thrill of the hunt!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Fuck yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Sigh...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: But seriously that brobot has been the bane of my existence ever since you sent it.</p>",
