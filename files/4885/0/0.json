You shout a few obscenities his way. You wonder aloud what a guy has to do to get a decent meal around here. Hey, you're TALKING to that guy. It's no use though. He ignores you.\r<br/> <br/>Just look at that stoic face. The unshakeable discipline. The stalwart sense of duty and pride. This is what it means to be a member of the Prospitian Royal Guard. \r<br/> <br/>What a load of shit, you grumble to yourself, but loud enough for him to hear.</p>",
