I am surrounded 8y ghosts and kind of fre8king out a8out it!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">I know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">I'm asking what you intend to do about it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I don't know, I guess I will just curl into a little 8all and cry and hope they go aw8y!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Is that what you want to hear you sick f8ck????????</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">Aren't you going to kill her?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Who????????</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">Your friend.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">The one who summoned the spirits.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Will that make them go away?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">Does it matter?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">She brought them here to torment you. This obviously warrants revenge.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">You know you're going to anyway. You won't be able to help yourself.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I don't have to do shit!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: May8e I don't mind ghosts. May8e they'll 8e gr8 company once I get used to them!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">No, they are terrifying you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">There's only one thing to do.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Ok, so why don't YOU kill her! 8e my guest! Wow, thanks for offering. Wh8t a pal!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">That's not how I work.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Oh really, well you seemed pretty excited a8out killing Tavros too.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: And you even helped! So I guess that is how you work after all.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">Not really.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">All I did was stand somewhere for a few minutes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">I just gave you an opportunity to do something you wanted to do anyway.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">You hated him, remember?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I know I did! I still do, I guess. I dunno.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ut I was never gonna kill these people. They were like, off limits I guess?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: These games were just supposed to 8e fun and serve no other purpose!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">They were serving a very important purpose.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yeah ok, you getting off on talking a girl into killing her 8uddies sure is important!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Los8r.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">Again, I didn't talk you into anything, nor am I doing so now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">You were, and are, going to do this regardless.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">I only ever place myself into positions of tangential involvement with events that will bring about my employer's entry into this universe.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">I oversee the events as they take place, and ever so slightly nudge them into motion when necessary.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I'm 8eginning to think you really 8elieve that! So delusion8l. You're just a path8tic, lonely gamer who 8uys into his own character profile 8S.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">The omniscient have no need for beliefs and no room for delusion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Hahahahahahahaha!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: You're the dum8est omniscient person I ever met.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Sure you know a lot, 8ut I know for a FACT there's stuff you don't know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">That's true.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">But the gaps in my knowledge exist by design.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">They are the pillars of shadow on which my comprehensive vision is built.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">Necessary pockets of void meant to effectuate outcomes I've foreseen and which will require my influence.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">Each dark pocket, in time, will be filled.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">But I wonder why I waste this nuance on you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ecause you need to add more 8l8tant lies to patch up all the holes in your sad cover story.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">I don't lie.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">Deception is only necessary for those like you to achieve their objectives.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">I play with my cards face up.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">Isn't it funny how during our various matches, I can tell you what my moves will be in advance, and still win?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: ::::P</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yeah, 8ut I'm getting closer to 8eating you. You'll see.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">Look at that. The short amount of time I have reserved for arguing with a child has expired.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">I will go.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">But maybe you're right. Maybe you are a person with free will and you won't kill your friend.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">What do I know?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #FFFFFF\">Enjoy your haunting.</p>",
