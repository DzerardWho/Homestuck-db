#e00707\">DAVE: is that how you pronounce that</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: yeah i guess so</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: i think its welsh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: what are welsh things doing in this game</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: thats an awesome question</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: fuck yeah it is</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: is this thing as pointless as i think it is or do i need it for something</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: tactically yeah its a downgrade since its what i used to make caledscratch which is obviously way better</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yeah thats what i figured</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: caledscratch cycles the sword through its own timeline to points when its broken or nonbroken or old and rusted or recently forged etc</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: and your snoop snowcone swords probably even better than that so yeah you got options</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: fuck it ill just power through the rest of the game with the SORD.....</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: hahahaha</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: with unreal air as a mount fit for a true artifact knight</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yeah</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: goddamn jpeg hero</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: right here</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: did that shit ever land or what</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: dude its long gone</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: up in skaia now or something</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: thrashing ill grinds on clouds</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: fuck</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: top priority make more</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: thats an order from your celestial fuckin spirit guide</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yeah you got it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: so why wasnt this legendary pos in the sylladex you gave me</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: did you chuck it after you alchemized it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: should i just chuck it too</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: it was stolen</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: by one of hephaestus's minions</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: hes the denizen right</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: yeah lord of the forge</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: isnt that like a greek god</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: or roman or whatever</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: what is greco roman shit doing in here you know what never mind</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: yeah pretty much</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: anyway he gets pissed off you broke it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: and he wants it back</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: to do something important with it though not really sure what</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: hes a pretty ornery dude</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: kept raving about how he was waiting for the forge to come</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: which he needs to complete his work</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: but in my timeline the forge would never come</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: so he was extra pissed off</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: whats the forge</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: volcano</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: huh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: you mean jades volcano</p>\n<p style=\"color:

mostly know stuff about your personal quest</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: what used to be my quest but i guess i got to deal with not being alpha dave no more</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yeah i guess</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: shrug</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: its all good</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: anyway that sword</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: its important to getting your shit figured out</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: you were supposed to break it to get it out of the thing</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: like another personal sort of mythological milestone you were supposed to clear</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: really</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: there was no other way to get it out</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: thats kind of retarded</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: well i dont know</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: maybe if john was to try with his pure heart and shit it woulda popped out like a champagne cork and fuckin hero confetti woulda blasted him in the face</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: but you</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: we</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: we had to break it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: ok</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: theres a lot more i know about your quest</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: all tangled up in ridiculous riddles and bullshit enigmas</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: and maybe its all a moot point anyway in this timeline who knows</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: but i think ill spare you all that crap</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: cause its kind of boring</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DAVESPRITE: and youll find out anyway</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yeah</p>\n<p style=\"color:
