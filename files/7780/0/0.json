#008141\">KANAYA: As Of The Immediate Point In Time</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: I Dont Know What To Do Anymore</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: hm??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: Before You Came</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: I Was On My Way To Join You And Rose And John</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: Feeling Quite Sure I Was About To Get Ready To Fight</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: But Then You Gave Me This</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: And Now Im Unsure Of Everything To Which I Just Imminently Committed Myself</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: how so</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: I Want To Help Us Win</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: But I Also Have A Lot Of Responsibility Now</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: In A Way That Is Much More Tangible And Also Spiky And Round And Sharp Than Just A Few Minutes Ago</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: And I Feel I Have To Consider Risk To Myself Is Now Also The Same As Risk To The Future Of My People</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: Does That Make Sense</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: ooh i see</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: yeah!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: it is like.....</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: like say a mother wolf being all ready to stand up to some other asshole of nature</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: like a nasty bear</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: and shes ready to fight and all but also shes got to think about what happens to her pups if she gets hurt yeah?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: Something Like That</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: Except Id Relate More To An Analogy That Didnt Involve Weird Alien Creatures</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: oh sure</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: just imagine instead of a wolf its like</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: a mother uhhhh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: help me out here</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: Musclebeast</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: a beautiful mother musclebeast</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: and instead of a bear</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: its um</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: a metroid</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: Lets Say Good Enough</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: damn straight</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: be fuckin fight of the year right there</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: but yes that concern is completely understandable</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: you dont gotta fight if you dont want!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: but im sure we could really use the help</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: Would I Actually Be Of Much Use</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: i think so!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: id look at it this way</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: none of this next gen troll stuff is even going to matter if we dont win this fight</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: so we have to prioritize beating all these goddamn villains</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: specially the witch!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: any extra edge is going to help</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: and tho i admit i dont know much about you i am feeling prrrettyyy confident in my assessment that u are probably some sort of sick deadly bitch</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: Who Told You My Secret</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: i knews it ;)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: in fact i would BET</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: that you could USE your concern for all ur future space pups to be WAY extra deadlier in this fray</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: maybe youd make the whole difference??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: the point is we need you now just as much as anyone in the future will</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: and we are ALL riskin stuff and ALL in this together and if youre with me and rose and john, dont worry we aint gonna let anything happen to you</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: i promise!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: Dang</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: dang?</p>\n<p style=\"color:

#008141\">KANAYA: A Little Corny But Definitely Genuine And Moving</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: And Now Im Suddenly Psyched Again To Go Dunk A Narcissistic Fish Woman Into A Sea Dumpster</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: FUCK YES</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: Not To Project Myself As Someone Fickle Or Lightly Swayed On Big Decisions</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: Maybe It Was Just A Roughly Thirty Second Spell Of Cold Feet And I Just Snapped Out Of It I Dont Know</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: But You Really Do Seem To Have A Way With Motivational Words</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: You Must Be A Natural Leader</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">KANAYA: I Think Your Group Was Lucky To Have You</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: me?? nuhhh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: im not naturally good at that at all</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: i mostly just yelled at my friends cause they were such a gaggle of frustrating bozos</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: i guess im just feeling way inspired by the fact everyone is here together and we are all about to try and do something huge and important</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: ive also watched john in action a bit and he is VERY good at that stuff</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: hes actually so good at being inspiring
