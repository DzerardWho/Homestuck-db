WHY ARE THESE WORDS HAPPENING TO OUR CONVERSATION.)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i dunno man</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: not sure what youve been doing the last 3 years all riding a large boat, then saving everyone from apocalyptic whatever</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but ive had a fuck ton of time on my hands to think about stuff</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: about stuff ive said and done in the past why i said and did them</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: a lot of things i once would have insisted were like part of my brand and helped me come across cool and smartassy</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but now im not so sure</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: we used rip on each other all the time for being gay even though we knew we werent which of course is what made it \"funny\" remember</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: yeah.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i dunno, it was pretty funny, sometimes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: it was just a lot of joking around!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yeah i know</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: it frankly IS funny to say how gay something is sometimes and lets face it sometimes someone or something is just flat out REALLY fucking gay and theres no two ways about it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: its more like that through the preponderance of all that jokey shit is an underlying implication that its all lame stuff for pansies but not like us no were not lame and ha ha thats the joke</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: which thrives on this like double-buried implication that the REAL COOL SHIT is founded on this absurd wanky ideal about masculinity which if you think about it is 1. dumb as fuck 2. the male adulation of masculinity to that extent TO BE HONEST is pretty fucking gay unto itself and 3. was always some totally impossible shit for us to live up to anyway</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i think all thats mixed up with the same phony ideals about heroism</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: like living up to the storybook idea of what a hero to me feels almost interchangeable with living up to societys snapshot of what a hard manly dude should be</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i stopped pretending i could ever live up to either thing a while ago</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: and mainly have spent time looking back on the sheer magnitude of all my \"joking around\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i used to lambaste fuckers left and right grinding them into the pavement over how gay they probably were and how much they were quite possibly jonesin to kiss some dudes or such</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: and i dont really feel bad about it in the sense that it was jerky or like \"insensitive\" necessarily even though i guess it maybe was</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: more that i feel like it was probably transparent</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: a massive front of outrageous snark to disguise a lot of insecurity</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: like a fuckin coverup</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: as long as i kept clowning hard about it i didnt actually have to think about it or face my actual beliefs</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: dave, um.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: all that's cool and all, and...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i think i mostly agree?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: ummmm, how do i put this.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: are you...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: are you gay now?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: what no</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">KARKAT: (THE WORDS. WHY WON'T THE WORDS STOP. DEAR GOD.)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i dunno, it sounds to me like you're trying tell me something here!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: man no look</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i mean, it's ok if you're gay now!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: that's totally cool, if true.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i just think...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: you turning gay would be kind of a weird consequence of me changing the time line around?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: ok, not \"weird\"...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: just, unexpected!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i dunno what i did that would account for that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: maybe saving one of terezi's plush toys did some goofy homosexual butterfly effect thing on you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: jeez, who knows!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: dude you arent listening</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: although a gay butterfly effect is a pretty funny idea lets not dismiss that as a concept altogether</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: anyway maybe what im tryin to say is sorta getting lost in the weeds here</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: the fact that you were wondering if i \"turned gay\" makes me think maybe youre still not quite on the wavelength im tryin to ramble on here</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: maybe we should wrestle this topic to the ground another time, theres a lot more id wanna say but this is probably not the venue</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i mean not literally wrestle to the ground because that is maybe literally the gayest course of action we could possibly take but you know what i mean</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">KARKAT: (YES! LATER! TALK LATER, BECAUSE THEN THE WORDS WOULD STOP! OH WOULDN'T THAT BE LOVELY.)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: that's fine, we can talk about anything you want, any time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i'm just still confused about what you're getting at, is all.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: like, what is the bottom line here?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: are you actually attracted to boys now?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: do you...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: um.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: did you...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: like, date any boys?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: uh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but there weren't even that many boys on the meteor?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: well, there's the clown guy, but i don't really see you and him...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: that really only leaves...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: um, were you and karkat...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: ARE you and karkat, like.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: hmm.</p>",
