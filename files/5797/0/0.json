I really am a dope.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I guess i did know deep down at some point... but then i somehow convinced myself otherwise?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I cant even imagine how she must have felt all this time i was seeing dirk. And all those times i talked her ear off about our relationship! Oh goodness.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: yuuup</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I wonder what things would be like if she told me?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Maybe its better she didnt in the end.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I probably would have just broken her heart like i did with dirk.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I should say something to her but im not sure what to say. I dont think she wants to hear anything from me to be honest.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Maybe you could tell her im sorry for me?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: why cant you just tell her</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: shes right there</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I dunno. Shes obviously so mad at me. I cant bring myself to say anything.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Im also just really fucking chagrined over how i treated her.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: If i was brave i could face that feeling and just talk to her and try to make us square.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: But i dont think i really am brave.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Im not brave and i dont think i love adventure either.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: wow... jake...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: You know how you think you know these things about yourself?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Like all these personal attributes about you as if theyre written down somewhere like a sort of mini biography so they have to be true.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: So you just believe them and hope that the believing is what makes them true.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: But then you spend so much time believing those things and taking their truth for granted that you somehow forget to MAKE them true with your words and deeds.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: How can i truly love adventure when i never even knew what it was?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I dont think its raiding tombs and clobbering scoundrels.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: That stuffs fun and all but thats not what adventure is.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Adventure is...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Its something else.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Its doing the things im genuinely afraid to do.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: But cant.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Because im a coward.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: ok ok stop shittin on urself ill tell her for you</p>",
