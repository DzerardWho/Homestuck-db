So she can't have gone far.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Oh snap.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I don't see her anywhere in the rest of the house.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I see plenty of plush wizards and window gizmos, and... pumpkins? Really, Roxy?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: What an unusual house design. Are all homes in the future like this?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: You mean the ones that aren't under water? Yes. They are all almost exactly like that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I just tried messaging her. But no response.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I'm sure she's out cruising the hood, probably messin' with the locals.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Maybe attempting some ill advised drunken heroics.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Pretty tight numerical probability of that, I just decided with unfeeling precision.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: She said things were on fire when we last talked?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Actually, she said the whole neighborhood was burning down, if I recall.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: But judging by the view from her window, it looks lovely outside.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: What exactly is the danger I am saving her from here?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Zoom out.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Way out.</p>",
