Something to set me far apart from the commoners.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: you built it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Of course not. Ro8ots 8uilt it for me when I was very young.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ut I was allowed to dict8 instructions. Expected to, in fact.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: oh gosh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: so rad.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Really?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I still find it interesting what sort of mundane facts humans tend to 8e impressed 8y.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Anyway, my design kind of got 8oring as I got older. A huge castle hive sounds great, 8ut it starts feeling pretty cavernous and lonely after a while. There were so many 8locks I never even used!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Your tastes change, 8ut you get stuck with growing up in a place suited to your earliest, most juvenile inclin8ions.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: No8ody tells you that when you're a kid though.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: i think i know what you mean.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: i feel like a long time ago, i might have given my dad the impression i really liked clowns?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: and now there are clowns everywhere, his stupid collection just keeps growing and growing, and it drives me CRAZY.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: John........</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: That 8arely compara8le example is so cute, I don't even know what to say.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: heheh.</p>",
