He was going to wash it today. He's probably taking it into the back yard next to the garden hose. He keeps a very busy fatherly itinerary. So many dad things to do, every single day.\r<br/> <br/>If the mail arrives soon, this would be a great opportunity to sneak out and get it! Fingers crossed.</p>",
