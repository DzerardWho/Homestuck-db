You could always relate to the role he played as George Michael, the dorky child of a single, doting father. But unlike you, George Michael was always surrounded by an extended family and their hilarious antics, and he would never know the tragedy of losing everyone he ever loved. You suddenly resent George Michael and the HALLWAY CERA altogether for the happy ending he was allowed to have with his father which you will never get to experience. \r<br/> <br/>In fact, you think you are starting to hate the HALLWAY CERA. Someone needs to wipe that smug look off his face.</p>",
