A session with one Skaia about which twelve planets would circle. With one army of dark and one of light. With one pair of kings and one pair of queens. And with one cantankerous archagent and his typical disdain for authority. It wouldn't be until later in the session when the full chain was nearly closed that you would realize the truth. \r<br/> <br/>The truth was it had always been the same session all along. That your teams were not competing, but cooperating toward a common goal.</p>",
