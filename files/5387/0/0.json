For a while.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: It didn't really work out.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: oh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: We crossed paths every now and then after that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Things stayed pretty friendly 8etween us.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Until he died.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: what??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: what do you mean he died?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: He was murdered.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: you mean... his GHOST died?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: as in, he just doesn't exist at all anymore? like DEAD dead?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Yes! Dead dead. For good.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i don't... how does that even...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: who killed him???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: was it jack?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Jack? Are you kidding? No, John.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Jack is 8arely in the picture as a threat anymore. He's just more old news.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: he is not old news though!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: he's still as strong and menacing as ever.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i just had an awesome battle with him in this very dream bubble!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: You did?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: yeah. i found him skulking around a memory of my dead dad, and i got pissed off, so i really let him have it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: oh, i even used the cool hammer you helped me make. remember that?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Oh yeah!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Those were good times, when I helped you 8e gr8. ::::)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: the last time i faced him was kind of embarrassing. i let him get the drop on me, and he just stabbed me right away.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but this time i think i held my own pretty well. i even got in one good hit against him!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i gave him a solid bop on the head, and the dice roll made him wear a silly hat.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: That's awesome!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: One time in an altern8te reality, I came pretty close to killing him apparently.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: oh really?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: You 8et. Too 8ad that was in a timeline that didn't really count. 8ut it's always reassuring to know you can put up a good fight against a strong adversary if you ever needed to. Now I guess you know you can too.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i guess so!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: What happened after you 8onked him on the head? I 8et he was mad.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: yeah, he sure was. but our fight was interrupted by like... another taller, white jack dressed in rags.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: A white Jack?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: well, no, it wasn't actually a jack, it was someone different altogether, who just looked like him. with wings and a sword and everything.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i think the white jack was probably a girl? i'm not sure, but that was my hunch. i didn't talk to her or anything. she looked really angry.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: anyway, he seemed scared of her, so he flew away, and she chased him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: do you know who she was?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: No fucking clue.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: whatever jack's doing out here in dream bubble land, he seems to have his hands full with her on his tail.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but as you can see, he is FAR from out of the picture.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Ok, that may 8e, 8ut it sure wasn't Jack who killed a whole shitload of ghosts out here, including one of yours.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I really dou8t Jack can even kill ghosts. In fact, I don't think anyone can except for this guy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: what guy?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Lord English.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: who??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Wow, John. Really?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Wow.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Time to get a clue!</p>",
