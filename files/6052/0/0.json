IMPECCA8LE prose. Failing to do it justice would be the real matter of gray morality here, if you ask me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: 8ut right now I 8n't in the mood to figure out how not to make it fucking suck.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: So I'll just say this.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: It was supposedly a weapon that once 8elonged to him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: 8ut he could never use it without altering its nature.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Meaning he could only use it once.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: So he did.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: After that, it could only 8e used again one more time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: And only as a weapon against him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Knowing it was one of the keys to his defeat, he had it locked away deep in the void.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: That's it. Part one of my story. Hold your applause.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Guess we'll find out if that's true.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Or if it turns out all my despica8le shit was in vain.</p>",
