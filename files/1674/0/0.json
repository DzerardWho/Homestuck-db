    "pesterlog": "<p>Homestuck <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">began</a> on April 13th, 2009, the 13th birthday of our chief protagonist and future <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/881\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">boy-skylark</a>, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/3\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">John Egbert</a>. <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/22\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Three days prior</a> was supposed to be the day he received the Sburb <a href=\"http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=5\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Beta</a> in the mail, but it was running late. It showed up <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/86\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">later that afternoon</a>, and after overcoming <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/90\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">a variety</a> of <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/92\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">domestic adversities</a>, he <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/100\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">retrieved the game</a>, along with a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/99\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">birthday package</a> from his internet friend, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/311\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Dave Strider</a>.</p>\n<p>John soon established a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/136\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">game connection</a> with another friend, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/216\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Rose Lalonde</a>, who'd spent the day <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/135\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">badgering him</a> about playing with her, after unsuccessfully attempting to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/35\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">convince Dave</a> to play. Upon <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/137\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">connecting</a>, Rose was able to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/139\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">manipulate John's environment</a>, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/163\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">move his furniture around via cursor</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/148\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">restructure the shape of his room</a>. John was <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/153\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">unable</a> to do this to Rose's environment however. He'd installed the client copy of the beta, and required the server copy for that.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/85\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">server copy</a> was trapped in his dad's car, along with a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1556\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">birthday package</a> from another friend, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/768\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Jade Harley</a>. Jade <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/169\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">messaged</a> John inquiring about the package. As of this moment, neither her package nor the server copy has been recovered by <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/508\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">John</a>. Rose had also prepared a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1089\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">package</a> for John, but had not mailed it yet. It still sits in her room. <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/132\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Dave's package</a> contained the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/404\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">authentic stuffed bunny</a> <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1601\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">from Con Air</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to allowing Rose to control John's environment, Sburb provided an array of <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/151\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">devices</a> Rose <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/156\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">deployed</a> <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/157\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">throughout</a> John's house. <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/527\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">These devices</a> used together provided a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/617\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">system</a> by which the players could <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/625\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">manufacture any item</a> using <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/523\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">the code</a> on the back of that item's captchalogue card, if they gathered enough grist to pay for it. Later, they would learn to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/634\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">combine item codes</a> to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1052\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">master the art</a> of punch card alchemy, whereby items could be fused together in <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1056\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">purpose</a> and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1055\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">design</a>.</p>\n<p>One device on being <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/176\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">activated</a> began a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/178\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">countdown</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/177\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">released</a> an entity called a kernelsprite. The countdown ticked down to the moment John's house would be <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/196\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">struck by a meteor</a>, destroying his neighborhood. To escape this demise, John had to use the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/181\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">devices</a> <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/205\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">to manufacture</a> a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/210\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">special item</a> that looked like a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/245\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">blue apple</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/246\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">take a bite</a> of it, in order to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/250\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">transport</a> his entire house just before impact to the safety of a mysterious dark realm, where his house would situate itself atop a tall rock column high above a blanket of clouds. This realm is called the Medium.</p>\n<p>Before he entered the Medium though, John and Rose <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/185\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">prototyped</a> his kernelsprite with the large harlequin doll his dad got him for his birthday, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/186\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">transforming</a> the sprite to bear its likeness, including the ways the doll was disfigured via earlier hijinks. It had a slashed eye and one arm, and so too did the sprite. When John entered the Medium, the sprite's kernel <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/251\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">hatched</a>, thus imbuing all the enemies John and his friends would face with properties of the sprite. The lesser adversaries John faced first, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/393\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Shale Imps</a>, all wore harlequin garbs. They became more powerful and more radically mutated with each successive pre-Medium prototyping.</p>\n<p>After <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/250\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">entering the Medium</a>, John's dad was <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/421\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">kidnapped by imps</a>. While John was looking for him, he accidentally <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/281\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">prototyped the sprite</a> with his grandmother's ashes, transforming it again. This prototyping had <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/387\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">no effect on the enemies</a>, since he was already in the Medium, and the kernel had already hatched. Instead, only the sprite was affected, and it took on the appearance, personality, and memories of his grandmother, becoming <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/284\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Nannasprite</a>, a game-supplied albeit customized guide for John. She <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/420\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">explained aspects of the game</a>, about <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/422\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Skaia</a> residing at the center of the Medium, beyond seven gates floating directly above his house, and about an <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/423\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">eternal/timeless war</a> fought there between dark and light, one that light was always <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/424\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">destined to lose</a>.</p>\n<p>Rose, who'd been having frequent <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/173\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">internet connection issues</a>, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/290\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">lost her connection</a> as she tried to lift John's car to retrieve the game and the package. The car <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/291\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">fell into the abyss below</a>. <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/214\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">A storm</a> caused her house to lose power along with its wireless internet connection. Her laptop was able to run on battery power for a time, while she tapped into the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/239\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">wireless signal</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/986\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">laboratory next door</a>. When her laptop <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/295\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">ran out of power</a>, she had to overcome more <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/388\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">family strife</a> (and endure a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/390\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">gift pony</a> in the process), go <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/307\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">outside in the rain</a>, and plug it into the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/413\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">small generator</a> outside the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/412\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">mausoleum</a> of her dead cat, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/929\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Jaspers</a>. She <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/415\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">continued her session</a> with John inside the mausoleum, while the meteor-sparked forest fire surrounding her house grew more intense.</p>\n<p>From the house, Rose's mom <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/757\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">opened</a> a secret passage in the mausoleum to help her escape. <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/840\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">The passage</a> lead to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/847\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">the lab</a> next door,  where Rose <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/866\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">found</a> a stable, portable source of power and internet for her computer. She also found <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/874\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">a terminal</a> projecting the impact times and locations for the millions of meteors presently bombarding the planet, along with all the other live sessions of other players around the world. She also found a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/905\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">little girl's room,</a> <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/907\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">a mutant kitten</a> she named <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1002\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Vodka Mutini,</a> and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/933\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">a cloning machine</a> operating through the science of <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/934\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">ectobiology</a>. Its terminal was <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/929\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">locked</a> on to her cat Jaspers at <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/938\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">whatever point in his life</a> the user specified.</p>\n<p>She attempted to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/931\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">appearify</a> Jaspers from a moment in her early childhood, before he <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/935\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">whispered a secret</a> to her. But doing so would have caused a paradox, so it <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/932\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">appearified (paradoxified)</a> a pile of slime instead. The machine used the slime to create a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/934\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">fetal paradox clone</a> of Jaspers in a glass tube. On the monitor, Jaspers then told young Rose the secret, then <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/936\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">vanished</a>, only to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/937\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">show up</a> dead weeks later and put in the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/938\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">mausoleum</a> for years until the present. Rose <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/941\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">left</a> the laboratory moments before it was destroyed by a meteor <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/987\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">impact.</a> She <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/985\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">transportalized</a> back to her mom's room, proceeded to her room to wait for Dave to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1148\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">connect</a> with her and rescue her from the next imminent impact.</p>\n<p>Dave was <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/294\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">charged</a> with acquiring his bro's copy of the game to help Rose. Earlier he had lost his copy of the game to a mishap involving a crow. It flew in his window, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/353\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">seized the game</a>, and Dave accidentally <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/355\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">impaled it</a> with a sword, sending the crow and the game out the window onto a landing <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/444\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">far below</a> his apartment. He <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/610\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">searched his bro's room</a> unable to find it, was <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/463\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">briefly shadowed by Lil Cal</a>, and then <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/612\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">found a note</a> beckoning him to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/665\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">meet on the roof</a> for a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/836\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">confrontation</a>. Dave and his bro <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/871\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">dueled on the roof extensively</a>, and Dave was <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1070\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">thoroughly bested</a>. Upon defeating Dave, his bro dropped the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1071\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">copies of the game</a>, and flew off on his rocket board into the sky.</p>\n<p>Dave used the copies to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1148\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">connect with Rose</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1149\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">quickly deployed the devices</a> while her house was on fire, surrounded by flaming tornadoes, and minutes away from being destroyed by a meteor. Rose prototyped her kernelsprite with Jaspers, specifically to understand the meaning of the secret he whispered to her years ago. She was advised to do this by Jade, who <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/838\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">told her</a> about the game in the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/442\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">first place</a>. Dave then prototyped the kernelsprite again with the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/363\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">tentacled princess doll</a> given to Rose on her birthday by her mom. Both of these prototypings would have an <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1582\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">effect on the enemies</a> once Rose entered the Medium and the kernel hatched. Rose used the alchemiter to create the special item - for her, a purple wine bottle - which she needed to break to enter. She eventually did, transporting her house just before the meteor collided.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/875\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">meteor</a> left a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1149\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">crater</a>. Over time, at the site of impact, a large, white structure that looked like a wine bottle grew there, and the crater filled up with sand as the climate of the post-apocalyptic Earth gradually changed. The <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/757\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">\"cork\"</a> of that bottle was a large metal <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/727\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">cylinder</a> with an interior much like an advanced science station, with a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/733\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">variety</a> of <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/669\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">devices</a> and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/705\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">monitors</a> inside. 413 years after the meteor impact, the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/666\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Wayward Vagabond</a> walked through the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/248\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">desert</a> and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/271\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">discovered</a> this station. <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/waywardvagabond/anunsealedtunnel/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Inside</a>, he <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/708\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">found</a> canned <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/681\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">rations</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/694\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">firefly</a> he named <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/750\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Serenity</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/736\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">appearifier</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/705\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">four monitors</a> hooked up to a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/439\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">keyboard</a>.</p>\n<p>On one of the monitors was John, just after he'd entered the Medium. WV could <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/439\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">type commands</a> to John directly, much as the readers of this story could type commands for the characters to follow. Most of John's <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/253\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">actions</a> upon entering the Medium were <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/435\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">authored by WV</a>, until he became preoccupied with <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/710\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">other activities</a>, such as <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/685\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">building a town</a> out of cans, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/721\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">playing chess with cans</a>, and drawing chalk murals depicting the cosmological arrangement of Skaia, the Medium, the light and dark planets known as <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/702\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Prospit</a> and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/704\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Derse</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/703\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">four planets</a> the kids would each occupy upon entering the game, called <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1152\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">The Land of Wind and Shade (John)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1430\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">The Land of Light and Rain (Rose)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1645\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">the Land of Heat and Clockwork (Dave)</a>, and Jade's planet, which is yet to be seen.</p>\n<p>He also activated a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/717\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">countdown</a> in the station which caused it to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/757\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">blast</a> out of the crater and fly to designated \"home\" coordinates. Along the way, it passed over the sand-filled crater that was the impact site for John's meteor, on the other side of the continent. John's meteor had caused a giant white tree to grow in the crater. The tree grew an <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/waywardvagabond/windsdownsideways/04.gif\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">apple-like station</a> from a branch, which fell to the sand. The Peregrine Mendicant found this station. After WV flew overhead, PM <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/waywardvagabond/windsdownsideways/03.gif\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">activated</a> her station's homing feature as well, which caused it to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/waywardvagabond/windsdownsideways/07.gif\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">fly</a> to the same destination. Along the way, she used her terminal to attempt to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/900\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">command Jade</a>, who from the perspective of the terminal, had just arrived in the Medium. This caused the terminal to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/902\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">explode</a> for unknown reasons, leaving a hole in the station. One of the station's robotic worms <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/924\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">recovered</a> one of PM's falling mailboxes, and she <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/925\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">befriended</a> it, after earlier <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/waywardvagabond/windsdownsideways/01.gif\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">slaying</a> another one with her black <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/waywardvagabond/asentrywakens/05.gif\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">regisword</a>.</p>\n<p>WV <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1006\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">landed</a> at the site of the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1008\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">ancient frog ruins</a> across the now dried up Pacific Ocean. The site was once the island where Jade lived, but nothing of the island remained except for the ruins. The mountain her house was on, and the volcano next to it, were replaced by a large empty chasm. PM <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1035\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">landed</a> shortly after WV, and they <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1044\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">met</a>. They were confronted by the Aimless Renegade, who <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1040\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">fired</a> at <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1042\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">them</a> from the frog ruins with old weaponry he'd been hoarding, once belonging to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1103\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Jade's grandpa</a>. Millions of years ago, the frog ruins <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/757\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">grew</a> from a crater, struck by a meteor that emerged from a Sburb portal in space. Jade's radioactive, omnipotent, space-warping dog named Becquerel <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1073\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">emerged</a> from this crater as well.</p>\n<p>Jade's <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/915\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">grandpa</a> <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1131\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">pioneered</a> this <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/822\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">island</a>, and built the house Jade lives in. Her <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/919\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">grandpa</a> has been <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/920\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">dead</a> for many years, and stands stuffed in <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/915\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">front</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/911\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">fireplace</a>. She has been <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/982\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">looked after</a> by her <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1132\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">dog who she calls Bec</a>. She begins the day with several <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/791\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">tasks</a>  to accomplish - to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/980\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">feed Bec, and to retrieve</a> a birthday <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/998\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">package</a> <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1000\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">mailed</a> by John. She <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/818\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">irradiates</a> a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/816\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">steak</a>, and heads <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/942\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">outside</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/945\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">site</a> where the package will be <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/822\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">dropped</a>. She knows it will be dropped there because one of the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/777\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">reminders</a> she wears on her fingers jogs her memory about it. She wears them to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1075\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">keep track</a> of the many <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/843\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">things</a> she knows about the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/994\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">future</a>, through <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1073\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">dreams</a>.</p>\n<p>She falls asleep frequently and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/917\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">spontaneously</a>. When she sleeps, her <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/993\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">dream self</a> is awake, and living on the moon that orbits the light planet, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1026\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Prospit</a>. Prospit very closely orbits Skaia, a huge sphere of blue sky and clouds, which nanna describes as a \"dormant crucible of unlimited creative potential.\" When Prospit's moon <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1051\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">eclipses</a> Skaia, it drifts into Skaia for a time, mingling with the clouds. Dream Jade then <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1073\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">witnesses</a> many past and future events in the clouds. While asleep, she is often confused about what is real and what isn't. When she wakes up, she <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1075\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">pieces together</a> future events from her memory of the cloud visions, and from logs recorded by her dreambot. Her <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/994\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">dreambot</a> is a robotic surrogate that activates while she sleeps in her bed. It mimics in the real world the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1449\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">movement and actions</a> of her dream self on the moon, and records a video log of what she sees while dreaming.</p>\n<p>Prospit's <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1051\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">moon</a> has two <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1047\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">towers</a> of identical design, and similar design to Jade's house. <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/993\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Dream Jade</a> lives in one tower. <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1049\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Dream John</a> lives in the other. Dream John is still asleep, and John has no knowledge of the dream world, which is to say, the <a href=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/Tenebrais/MSPA/Incipisphere-5.png\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">entire game session</a> he would initiate on his 13th birthday. When he goes to sleep, instead of waking up on the moon as Jade does, he remains slumbering in his dream room, tormented by his subconscious. This torment is expressed when he sleepwalks, and draws troubling <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1004\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">scribbles</a> on the walls of his room. When <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">awake</a>, he cannot see the scribbles, as is subconscious suppresses his awareness of them. It is not until he has a perception-altering <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/948\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">revelation</a> about his dad does he begin to see them. He initially believed they were new additions to his room, perhaps <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1003\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">scrawled</a> by imps. However they were present long before, visible in his room while he prepared Jade's birthday package <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/999\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">months ago</a>.</p>\n<p>John prepared a package for each of his three friends, whose 13th <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/999\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">birthdays</a> were December 1st (Jade), 3rd (Dave), and 4th (Rose). He gave <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1090\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Rose</a> a knitting set, and she then took an intense interest knitting. He gave <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1096\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Dave</a> the pair of shades Ben Stiller wore in Starsky and Hutch, which <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1098\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">he wore</a> from then on, replacing the shades in the style his bro wore. He gave <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1134\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Jade</a> a blue version of his own ghost shirt, and some pumpkin seeds to help her replace the pumpkins that kept disappearing from her garden. But she did not receive this on the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1132\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">birthday</a> John intended. She received it in the past, on her birthday when she was very young, causing her to take an interest in <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1136\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">gardening</a> in the first place, to take a liking to blue apparel, and to eventually befriend John over the internet and lead him, Rose, and Dave down a path where they would ultimately play this game together.</p>\n<p>Jade did <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/980\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">retrieve</a> his package in the present as planned, but immediately <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1112\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">took it</a> to another location where it <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1113\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">disappeared</a>. WV in the far future <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1012\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">appearified</a> it from that location on accident. The package contained further <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1014\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">instructions</a> for him. He was to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1039\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">bring it</a> to PM, and she was to use her station's <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1128\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">sendificator</a> to send it to another place and time. After she did this, the package <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1133\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">appeared</a> in front of young Jade on her birthday. Jade orchestrated the sequence of events through knowledge of them by her cloud visions.</p>\n<p>She orchestrated similar events for the package she sent to John, plotting the circuitous route through time and space it was meant to follow. She again utilized the exiles for help, while they were still in the Medium. The exiles, WV, PM, and AR, were all formerly agents of the kingdoms, before they were exiled by some means to post-apocalyptic Earth. AR, as an <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1456\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Authority Regulator</a> in the Land of Wind and Shade, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1459\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">discovered</a> the package and the beta copy in John's wrecked car as he gave it a parking ticket. PM, working as a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1460\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Parcel Mistress</a>, recognized the package from a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1033\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">correspondence</a> she had with Jade on Prospit some time ago, and recalled it must be delivered to John. AR would not relinquish <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1480\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">the package</a>, though he did give her <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1481\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">the beta</a>, which she delivered into a pyxis to satisfy the carved request of a minitablet. John <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1490\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">carved</a> this tablet at the request of PM through the command terminal in the future.</p>\n<p>AR brought the package to Derse, where it ultimately wound up on the desk of <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/955\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Jack Noir</a>. Jack is the archagent of the dark kingdom, charged with overseeing affairs through his office's <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/955\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">fenestrated wall portals</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1550\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">processing paperwork</a>. He is forced to wear a silly <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/956\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">garment</a> in keeping with prototyping themes by the Black Queen, an order he <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/959\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">resentfully</a> complies with. He oversaw the imprisonment of John's dad, who broke loose on <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/950\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">multiple</a> occasions. When Jack went to handle it personally, John's dad <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1140\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">set</a> Jack's hat on <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1141\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">fire</a>. In a surly act of gratitude, he <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1144\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">released</a> the prisoner. John's dad fled to the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1358\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Land of Wind and Shade</a>, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1668\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">fought</a> large monsters, got his hat dirty and lost a shoe. He then carved tablet requests for new ones, which John <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1421\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">filled</a> via <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1422\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">pyxis</a>, unaware of who requested them.</p>\n<p>PM <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1483\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">followed</a> AR to Derse in hopes of retrieving the package. After <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1532\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">wandering around</a>, she encountered the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1535\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Black Queen</a> on her throne. Both the light and dark kingdoms each have a king and a queen. The queens sit on a throne, on Prospit and Derse respectively, ruling the planet. The kings command armies on the Battlefield, located at the center of Skaia. The queen takes on the attributes supplied by the prototypings due to the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/958\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">four-orbed ring</a> she wears. When the ring is removed, the queen is restored to normal. PM <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1536\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">showed</a> the BQ a parking ticket she was pretending to deliver. The BQ <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1537\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">directed</a> her to Jack's office, where the ticket should be filed.</p>\n<p>PM <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1549\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">met</a> Jack and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1551\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">asked</a> for the package. Jack proposed a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1553\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">deal</a>, and gave her a black <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1554\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">regisword</a>. If she would kill the White Queen and White King and bring him their crowns, he would give her the package. She accepted with little alternative. She then <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1612\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">visited</a> the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1613\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">WQ</a> on Prospit and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1614\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">explained</a> the situation, with no intention of carrying out Jack's mission. The WQ, understanding the futility of their situation and the need to recover the package, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1618\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">abdicated</a>, and gave PM her crown and her ring. PM was <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1619\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">instructed</a> to go find the White King, retrieve his crown, and receive further instruction on what to do with the ring to protect it. WQ would then eventually <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1543\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">exile</a> herself to post-apocalypse Earth.</p>\n<p>On post-apocalypse Earth, after AR <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1125\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">fired</a> on WV and PM from the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1359\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">ruins</a>, he spotted WV's <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1362\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">pumpkin</a>, which WV had earlier <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/738\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">appearified</a> from Jade's <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/764\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">house</a>. He recognized the carving of Bec's <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/943\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">silhouette</a> on the pumpkin. Fearful of it, he <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1363\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">surrendered</a>. The three exiles soon became <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1396\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">friends</a> over a campfire and shared <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1408\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">rations</a>. WV and AR built <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1500\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Exile Town</a> out of cans, mailboxes, and bullets. PM operated WV's station <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1416\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">terminal</a> to submit <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1419\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">commands</a> to John as he <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1358\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">explored</a> the Land of Wind and Shade. In the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1502\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">sky</a>, another station teleported and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1503\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">fell</a> to the ground. It was shaped like an egg, and originated from Dave's meteor impact site, in correspondence with the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1504\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">egg-shaped item</a> he would use to enter the medium. Emerging from this <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1544\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">station</a> was the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1543\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Windswept Questant</a>, formerly the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1613\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">White Queen</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1545\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">AR and WV</a> sought to impress WQ by <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1608\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">crafting</a> a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1609\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">crown</a> for her out of a mailbox. She refused the distinction, instead <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1621\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">giving</a> it to PM, who had successfully completed her <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1462\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">mission</a> to deliver Jade's <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/85\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">package</a> to John in the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1459\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">distant</a> past. The <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1480\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">means</a> by which she went about this have yet to be <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1556\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">seen</a>.</p>\n<p>John entered the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1358\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Land of Wind and Shade</a> (LOWAS) by having Rose <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1022\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">build</a> up his <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1081\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">house</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/425\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">first gate</a>, fighting through many imps and ogres with his powerful new <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1069\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">alchemized weapons</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1149\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">entering</a> the gate. This took him to a location beneath the clouds, far <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1429\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">below</a> his <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1150\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">house</a>. The LOWAS turned out to be a large <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1487\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">windy</a> <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1152\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">planet</a>, full of dark terrain, incandescent <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1395\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">trees</a>, networks of <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1420\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">pipes</a>, and oily <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1598\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">rivers</a>. In addition to hosting more <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1463\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">powerful</a> <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1435\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">adversaries</a>, the land is occupied by <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1428\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">friendly</a> <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1423\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">consorts</a>, a race of <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1488\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">salamanders</a>. They help John understand the mythos of the land, and inform him of the planet's persecution by a sleeping denizen, which is responsible for <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1597\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">clogging the pipes</a> with oil, and trapping fireflies under the clouds.</p>\n<p>Each planet has a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1605\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">sleeping denizen</a>, which the players must first wake, and then kill, in the course of their journey through the seven gates. Rose's planet, the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1407\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Land of Light and Rain</a> (LOLAR) is a multicolored ocean planet with white sandy islands and pink ruins, and has a denizen responsible for <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1626\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">killing all life</a> in the water. Dave's planet, the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1641\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Land of Heat and Clockwork</a> (LOHAC) is a lava planet, covered in industrial steel frame structures and turning gears, and has a denizen of yet unknown qualities.</p>\n<p>Killing the denizen releases a huge grist hoard buried at the core of the planet, which is then used to fuel a process known as <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1605\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">The Ultimate Alchemy</a>. Along the way, the kids are meant to learn about their destined roles in this <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/759\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">quest</a> as the Heir of Breath (John), Seer of Light (Rose), Knight of Time (Dave), and Witch of space (Jade). Over the course of their quest, the dark kingdom will <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/424\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">inevitably defeat</a> the light kingdom. The Black Queen and King will take control, and initiate <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1667\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">The Reckoning</a>. This affects a belt of meteors, called The Veil, which orbits far from Skaia, between the four planets and Derse, and is host to various lab facilities used by the kingdoms. The Reckoning causes the meteors to descend on Skaia, ultimately destroying it, unless the Black Queen and King can be defeated in time. Skaia however buys time by opening defense portals to catch many of the meteors, redirecting them <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/874\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">elsewhere</a> in space and time.</p>\n<p>This is the generic template for the way the game is supposed to proceed. It can deviate from this model however, depending on the actions of the players, and the details of the game mythology presented is unique to each group of players and their session.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1090\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Long before</a> John and his friends started playing the game, another group of players had been <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1093\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">persistently</a> <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1099\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">trolling</a> <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1528\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">them</a>, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/859\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">particularly Jade</a>. They are furious about an action she will take that will cause major problems in the four kids' game session, and inevitably lead to their defeat. Specifically, Jade will send <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/85\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">a package</a> to John, apparently containing a powerful weapon he will need later. But the package winds up in <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1556\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">the hands of Jack Noir</a>, leading to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1668\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">dire consequences</a>. They <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1667\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">allude to</a> other things she will do that will lead to not only trouble for the four kids, but the troll players as well. </p>\n<p>The trolls consist of 12 kids from <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1236\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">an alien planet</a>, who went through <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1355\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">the same process</a> as John and his friends, escaping from the annihilation of their planet via meteors, and into the Medium to play the game. Their game session is entirely separate from that of the four kids. It has the same basic template, with its own Skaia, Prospit, Derse, Veil, and a planet for each troll, but separate game instances of these. They also have different instances of the same character templates, such as the kings and queens, and agents like Jack Noir. </p>\n<p>The trolls have completed their game session with yet unknown results. They now reside on a meteor in their Veil, sitting at terminals trolling John and co. From their terminals they can choose any point in the past or future of the kids to troll, and observe what they're doing at that moment. As a group, their only stated objective is to harass the kids, which they do so haphazardly throughout different points in the kids' timeline. Though they can choose any point on the kids' timeline to talk, they are mostly resigned to the understanding that no matter what they do, they can't change the outcome of the kids' actions. </p>\n<p>The four most vociferous trolls so far have been <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1526\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">carcinoGeneticist</a>, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1530\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">gallowsCalibrator</a>, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1593\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">grimAuxiliatrix</a>, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1596\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">and adiosToreador</a>. (The other 8 being apocalypseArisen, twinArmageddons, arsenicCatnip, arachnidsGrip, centaursTesticle, terminallyCapricious, caligulasAquarium, and cuttlefishCuller, each yet to be heard from.) </p>\n<p>carcinoGeneticist (CG) appears to have spearheaded the group's trolling campaign. While he was in the thick of his game session, the exile commanding him from a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1353\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">terminal</a> in the apocalyptic future was <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1155\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Spades Slick</a>. This is one difference between his game session and John's, who had WV as an exile commanding him. In CG's session, his version of Jack Noir became <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1274\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">exiled</a> along the way, and took on the name Spades Slick. Three <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/957\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">other</a> <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1532\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">agents</a> were exiled, and the four of them formed a gang called the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/833\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Midnight Crew</a>, and spent years building up a dark city in the future wasteland of the trolls' dead planet. Another difference in the trolls' session is that at some point along the way, the Black Queen was also exiled, later joined a rival gang called <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1170\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">The Felt</a>, assumed special powers that make her highly inadvisable to kill, and came to be known as <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1267\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Snowman</a>. It was not until Slick confronted The Felt in their mansion that he discovered the station terminal to command CG, and not before Snowman <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1269\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">blinded him in one eye</a>, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1345\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">severed his arm</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1347\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">locked him in a vault</a>. </p>\n<p>Each troll has a different trolling strategy, and a different rhythm by which they hop around the kids' timelines to chat with them. CG's strategy, for the most part, was to begin trolling them at the very end of their adventure, the moment at which he was most angry with their actions, and then gradually work backwards, mostly talking to John. This proves to be <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1603\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">mutually frustrating</a> though, as John knows less and less about the situation the further into the past CG goes. Similarly, the further into the future John progresses, the more he has the advantage over CG by knowledge of his future conversations with him, and vice versa. Over the course of the opposing directions of the two sides of the conversation, John learns more about the nature of the game and why they're being trolled, and in spite of hostility, they gradually befriend each other through an inevitability alluded to on both sides of the conversation. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1394\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Early in the correspondence between John and CG</a>, which is to say late for CG, CG discovers he needs to get in touch with Jade, who refuses to talk to him in that time period. So he delivers a message to her much earlier, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1525\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">months in her past</a>, telling her she needs to contact him when she's in trouble. She will know to do this when her dreambot explodes in the future, an outcome that has not yet happened. </p>\n<p>Two other trolls, grimAuxiliatrix and adiosToreador (GA and AT) have targeted only Rose and Dave thus far. GA has hopped <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1592\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">arbitrarily back and forward</a> in Rose's timeline to talk to her, and is attempting to cultivate a friendship with her that now seems rigged through a series of conversational time loops, while seeking <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1589\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">counsel from Dave</a> on how to befriend her. AT sought <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1590\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">counsel from Rose</a> on how to troll Dave more effectively, after getting <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1099\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">severely counter-trolled</a> by him. He is under the impression he <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1595\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">rebounded nicely</a> though. </p>\n<p>gallowsCalibrator (GC) has stayed mostly linear in her trolling patterns, and has done so under the guise of helping the kids on their quest. She convinces John to take <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1580\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">a shortcut</a> through his land, shows him the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1605\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">denizen's palace</a>, leads him to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1607\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">warp back</a> to his house, then shows him how to fix the faulty rocket pack he made earlier through an <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/625\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">alchemy mishap</a>. She tells him to use the rocket pack to fly up to the seventh gate, enter the denizen's palace, and kill it in its sleep. He complied with this, and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1640\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">flew</a> through the seventh gate, in spite of reservations from Dave, who'd just <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1645\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">entered the Medium</a> the moment before John took off. </p>\n<p>GC also <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1524\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">assisted Rose</a>, just after <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1585\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">she bested an ogre with ease</a>. She counseled her on understanding her role as the Seer of Light, and the meaning of the voice in her head as an exile issuing commands from a terminal. In her case, it was the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1543\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">exiled White Queen</a> issuing commands from the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1503\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">egg shaped station</a> in the future. Since Dave is Rose's server player, the terminal station from Dave's impact site issues commands to Rose. Just as the station at Rose's site, which WV found, issues commands to John, her client player.</p>\n<p>After <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1592\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">conversing with GA</a>, Rose found Jaspersprite and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1626\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">interrogated him</a> about the secret which she found so maddeningly mysterious years ago. He explained elements of the mythos of her land, and how she'd need to learn to play the rain to produce the musical analogue of a genetic code to reintroduce life into the ocean. In response to her question about his secret, he simply replied \"Meow.\" She mistook this for more nonsense, but it was in fact the secret he told her years ago. The four letter sequence MEOW unlocked a genetic code in her subconscious, which she would spend years <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1627\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">scrawling</a> on her wall using those letters in place of the typically used GCAT letters, while completely oblivious to the scrawlings and their meaning just as John was. As Jaspers said, she would understand their meaning when her dream self wakes up.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1668\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Rose's dream self</a> lives in a tower on the moon of Derse. Dave's dream self lives on the same moon in the other tower. It was suggested by Rose's future self, who is fully awake in the tower, that Dave had already been awake in his tower all along without realizing it. This was suggested in a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1643\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">conversation</a> she had in the future with Dave. It was an alternative future timeline not meant to be.</p>\n<p>This future timeline came about by this series of events.</p>\n<p>Dave was able to enter the Medium by <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1393\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">connecting with Jade</a> as his server player. Jade <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1366\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">got copies of the game</a> from the frog ruins, after she <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1112\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">delivered John's package</a> to her past self. She snuck into the ruins while Bec was asleep, and retrieved the game from a lotus time capsule which had been ticking down for millions of years. The game was Dave's copy from the future, the same one that <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/355\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">fell out the window</a> with the impaled crow. Once she got the game, the time capsule started ticking down again, set to expire 413 years later, when the exiles are there. She dropped some items in the ruins, leaving them there for <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1409\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">AR to find</a>, and leaving her <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1111\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">bass jammed in the elevator</a>. Bec then <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1387\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">found her there</a>, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1388\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">took her back to her room</a>, and grounded her there for the rest of the evening.</p>\n<p>She quickly helped Dave <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1389\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">set up the game</a>, <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1515\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">upgrading</a> his <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1398\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">alchemiter</a> <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1574\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">heavily</a>, and crafting the special item he needed to enter the Medium, a <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1504\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">red egg</a>, which needed to be incubated and hatched to activate. She <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1446\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">prototyped his kernelsprite</a> with the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1445\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">impaled crow</a>, which would affect the enemies later, including the Black Queen. The sprite <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1507\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">built a nest</a> on top of his apartment's antenna tower, and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1506\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">stole the egg</a> to incubate it for hours. A very large meteor was soon <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1631\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">bearing down</a> on his city.</p>\n<p>Dave then entered the Medium through a series of unseen events. Jade was <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1627\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">asleep</a>, thus <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1447\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">forbidden by Dave</a> from <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1406\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">interacting</a> with his <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1437\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">environment</a> at all. Jade <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1629\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">complied</a> for fear of <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1449\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">retribution</a>. Dave was faced with the Crowsprite, which appeared to be suggesting he prototype it again with the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1082\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">remains of Lil Cal</a>. Dave <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1637\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">consulted with John</a> on this, who was about to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1639\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">rocket up</a> to the seventh gate. John had no advice, and proceeded up through the gate against better judgment.</p>\n<p>Dave prototyped the sprite <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1642\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">with Cal</a>. John entered the palace, presumably found the denizen, and was easily killed by it, as was the intent of GC's trick on him. This meant John could not establish a connection with Jade to rescue her from the <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/876\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">looming meteor</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1643\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Dave and Rose</a> lost contact with her, presuming her dead. Dave and Rose then spent the next four months in the Medium, advancing <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1641\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">as far as they could</a> to collect information before Dave decided to travel back in time to change events.</p>\n<p>Dave used his time tables to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1644\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">go back</a> to the moment he was about to prototype with Cal. Both <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1649\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">he and his past self</a> strongly urged John not to <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1652\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">go through the gate</a>. John was reluctant at first, but soon <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1663\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">reconsidered</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1664\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">flew down</a> beneath the clouds. Future Dave then gave Present Dave all his <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1650\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">advanced gear</a>, and prototyped the Crowsprite <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1651\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">with himself</a> to make Davesprite, thus serving as his own guide from the future. </p>\n<p>Before going back in time, Future Dave <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1643\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">convinced Future Rose</a> to go to sleep. He suggested her dream self would be unaltered by the timeline shift, and in her dream state she would remember the events from the future. <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1644\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">When Dave went back</a>, Rose's future dream self <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1655\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">assumed the position</a> of Rose's present dream self. <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1656\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Rose fell asleep</a>, and on <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1668\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Derse's moon</a>, she instantly woke up. She then saw all the genetic scrawlings she did in MEOW letters, and understood their meaning.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile on <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1668\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Derse below</a>, the Black Queen <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/958\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">again</a> insisted that Jack Noir abide by the dress code. He refused, and the queen threatened him. He picked up <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/997\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">Jade's package to John</a>, removed what was <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1555\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">inside</a>, and used it to slice her ring finger off. He then killed the Black Queen, put on the ring, and donned the full upgrade supplied by <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/185\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">the</a> <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1149\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">three</a> <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1446\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">prototypings</a>.</p>\n<p>He then became Jackspers Noirlecrow, which is a name I just made up now.</p>\n<p>And then after that <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1670\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">you started watching me</a> <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/1674\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">type</a> in this <a href=\"http://www.blackfives.com/blog_pics/carnegie_study.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">ridiculous study</a> I <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/family/?promoid=BPDEK\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">photoshopped</a> for myself with my <a href=\"http://andrewhussie.blogspot.com/2009/01/need-for-steed.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\">cool horse painting</a> propped up in the background.</p>",
