The blue blood has a present for you. The present cannot be duplicated via alchemy at this stage of the game. It would cost too much grist, a detail which this player had not been aware of. The player would have to progress to the second gate of their own world, arrive through the gate above your hive, and deliver it in person.\r<br/> <br/>Facilitating this delivery was one of the reasons why it was important for you to enter second.</p>",
