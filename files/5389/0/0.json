It's pro8a8ly 8est not to get into it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: None of that matters anymore anyway, it was so long ago. You know how it is.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: um. sure?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Issues 8etween people seem like such a 8ig deal when they're happening. 8ut then you die, and time just goes on, and on........ then on some more.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: If enough time passes, shit that used to 8e a 8ig deal kind of stops mattering.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Ok, full disclosure. I used to do a lot of terri8le things to Tavros.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Once I launched him off a cliff and paralyzed him. And if that wasn't 8ad enough, I spent sweeps mocking him for the disa8ility I caused! Haha.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Oh yeah. Then I killed him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: oh, right. i remember you said you killed someone that you cared about. i guess this is him?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Mm hm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: 8ut like I said, that's suuuuuuuuch old news now, it might as well not have even happened.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Tavros doesn't give a shit a8out that stuff anymore.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #a15000\">TAVROS: hEY, wAIT, mAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T, SPEAK FOR ME?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #a15000\">TAVROS: i STILL KIND OF THINK THAT STUFF WAS ALL PRETTY MEAN, eVEN THOUGH IT WAS FOREVER AGO,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #a15000\">TAVROS: iT'S JUST, i HAVE CHOSEN TO BE THE BIGGER MAN, aND NOT HOLD IT AGAINST LIKING YOU,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Hahahaha! John, can you 8elieve this guy?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: This is the kind of shit I have to deal with all the time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #a15000\">TAVROS: oH GOD,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #a15000\">TAVROS: nO, tIME OUT, i'M FLAGGING THIS, vRISKA, aS TERRIBLE BEHAVIOR,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Tavros, the 8igger man is only ACTUALLY the 8igger man if he doesn't refer to himself as the 8igger man. That's kind of the point?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Unless the intent is to produce some form of socially awkward comic relief, which let's face it, is what you're all a8out.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: 8ut that's what I like a8out you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #a15000\">TAVROS: yES, }:)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: hmm, i feel like... maybe we got sidetracked there?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: maybe you should tell me more about this english guy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: frankly, it seems like i'm usually one of the last people to learn about stuff like this, and it's starting to make me feel like a bit of a tool.</p>",
