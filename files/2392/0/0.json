And though we consider it a complicated subject, spanning a wide range of emotions, social conventions, and implications for reproduction, it is ultimately a superficial slice of what trolls consider the full body of romantic experience. Our concept of romance, in spite of its capacity to fill our art and literature and to rule our individual destinies like little else, is still just that. A single, linear concept. A concept usually denoted by a single symbol.\r<br/> <br/><span style=\"color: red\">&lt;3</span> <br/> <br/>Troll romance is more complicated than that. Troll romance needs four symbols.</p>",
