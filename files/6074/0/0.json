I dou8t even he knew the full extent of its powers.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: He supposedly got this thing as a 8oon for slaying a very powerful denizen. As if the guy even needed any more sick endgame rewards.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: That's all I'm gonna say for the moment, since I'm sure everyone is dying to see it 8y now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Only a complete asshole would make us w8 any longer to get a look at this thing.</p>",
