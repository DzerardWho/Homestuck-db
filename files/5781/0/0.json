NOW WHAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Caliborn, first let me explain something to you. </p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I guess it falls on me to teach you these life lessons, because as unpleasant as the idea is for both of us, I am the closest thing you will ever have to a father.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You see, teenagers are sensitive and beautiful creatures.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Well, not you. You are repulsive. But most teenagers, I mean.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You can't just force them to settle all their issues with insane psychotropic game powerups.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">They have to face all those issues themselves, or they will never learn and grow as people.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHO CARES??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Well, you don't. But human beings do.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">The journey itself is more important than the destination.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">The struggle is what builds character and teaches us about ourselves and about life.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">BULLSHIT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I DID THEM ALL A FAVOR. BY GIVING THEM MY JUJU.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THEY WERE GOING NOWHERE. AND BEING STUPID.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">AND DOING LITERALLY NOTHING WHATSOEVER. EXCEPT FOR WALLOWING IN GROTESQUE EMOTIONS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">LOOK HOW MUCH GREAT STUFF THEY GOT DONE BECAUSE OF ME!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Of course you think you were doing them a favor. You're an alien.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">So is your sister. She thought the juju would be a great boon for them as well. But she was wrong.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">See, you cherubs are predisposed to love all this trickster crap. All that goofy squeaky candy coated nonsense is a critical part of your people's mythos.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">That sugarized zillyjunk sort of embodies a unified field of absurd Platonic ideals to the cherubim, so when you see expressions of it in reality of course you're gonna go apeshit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">But that kind of stuff is freakish and disturbing to humans. Those aren't our ideals.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Furthermore, that could only be seen as a boon from an asocial species.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You never have to deal with other people. So if you lick a magic lollipop that flips a switch in your brain that says \"all my problems are solved,\" I guess maybe that's fine for cherubs, but if you're a human you haven't actually solved anything.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">By the same logic it's not much of a boon to a human's physical journey either.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Using an item that lets them start maniacally powering from point A to point B isn't doing them any favors.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">It's like when Mario gets the star.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You know when Mario gets the star?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHO THE FUCK IS MARIO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">He's a small Italian plumber who goes on sideways adventures.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">He jumps on stuff and bops bricks with his head to save a princess.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT'S ITALIAN.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT'S A PLUMBER.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Never mind what an Italian is. It's just a kind of guy on Earth.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">And a plumber is a guy who fixes load gapers.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT'S A LOAD GAPER.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Shut up.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Anyway, sometimes when Mario's running sideways he gets a star that makes him magic and invincible.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">OH. YOU MEAN HE BECOMES TRICKSTER MARIO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yes, but less stupid.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">So for a while he becomes flashy and hyperactive and nothing's challenging anymore.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">He just starts barreling over mushrooms and leaping over pits as fast as he can, then gets to the end and jumps on the flagpole and that's it. Mario \"wins\".</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">But the point is, he didn't really win. That magic star was actually devastating to his development as a human being.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHY.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Because he skipped over many critical trials on his spiritual journey.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Mario NEEDS to stomp on all those mushrooms. He NEEDS to bonk those bricks with his head, for the sake of his personal growth.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">By using the star, he is denying himself many powerful moments of catharsis.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">UH.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Well, I don't know. Maybe Mario isn't the best example.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Like I'm not sure if Mario really even has a soul?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">He's just kind of a one-dimensional friendly cartoon plumber.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">So maybe this stuff doesn't quite apply to him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">But these aren't one-dimensional plumbers we're talking about here.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">These are TEENS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">And as we all know, teens have BIG FEELINGS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I CAN'T TAKE ANYMORE OF THIS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THE DISCOURSE WITH YOU HAS BEEN EVEN MORE GRATING AND UNPALATABLE THAN USUAL.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YOU SAID YOU'D HELP ME SPEED UP MY QUEST. BUT ALL YOU DID.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WAS TRICK ME INTO HEARING ANOTHER CONVERSATION. IN WHICH YOU INDULGE YOURSELF TO AN EXTENT. WHICH I CANNOT EVEN BELIEVE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I'M GOING TO HIT THINGS WITH MY CROWBAR AGAIN.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">No don't!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Jane is still nursing a wicked hangover you ass.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THEN BE USEFUL TO ME.</p>",
