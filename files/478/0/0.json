Guess I can't really do that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: A broken piano isn't the end of the world though.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i guess you're right.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: You'll need to pick up the spoils in person. I can't interact with the grist.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: so...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: that means i have to go out the back door?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Yes. Is there a problem?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: well it may sound dumb, but i was hoping to avoid nanna and her spooky ghost cookies.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: You're right, that does sound dumb.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: can you see her in the kitchen? </p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Yeah.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: what's she doing, is she baking?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: You could say that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: are you SURE you can't get that grist up to me somehow?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Maybe.</p>",
