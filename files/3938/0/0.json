Just let it go.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: but this was my mission</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It really makes no sense for you to go.

I'm not sure about you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: why do you think that</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I am the pilot. That's all there is to say on the matter.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: but i dont want you to die</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Help John and Jade.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: this isnt right</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Then I'm not going to help you wake you up.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I'll stall some more.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: so you admit you were stalling with all that bullshit</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I said not entirely.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: what do you mean</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It's going to be a long ride through all this nothingness.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Maybe I just thought some company would be nice.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Before it's all over.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: ............</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: So what'll it be?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: what</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I'll wake you, but only if you promise to rejoin the others.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Could you give a message to John for me?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: sure</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: but</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: if im promising not to chase you down then theres not really any hurry to wake up</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Aw, are you sure?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I was looking forward to bowling another wicked googly with the yarn.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Sportsways.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: nah ill stay asleep a while</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: what did you want me to tell john</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: What was that?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: what</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Did you hear something?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: no what</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I thought I heard something outside.</p>",
