Have you heard from her?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: not the today that is local to yoU.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: thoUgh i do have a wee bit more troUble monitoring her than the rest of yoU. cUrioUs dark patches in transmission, hUmph.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: still, i woUldn't fret over it. she is as good a chUm as any yoU have and shoUld come throUgh Ultimately, even if things seem dire.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: If you say so.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Oh!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I wanted to tell you, I had an amazing dream last night!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: blimey! :U</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I believe it may have been of the sort you described. A dream of awakening, presuming I haven't just flatout lost my marbles.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: indeed, im sUre it was. i knew yoU woUld wake Up soon!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: might yoU describe what yoU saw?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I was in a bright gold city. Above was a brilliant blue sky, but the horizon was dark as night.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Was this the place you told me about? What was it called...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Ah, shucks, does this count as a \"causal spoiler?\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: not at all! that is a simple detail aboUt the realm yoU are aboUt to explore, withoUt directly involving yoUr fUtUre decisions of conseqUence.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: the place yoU visited was called prospit. it is where i have woken Up every time i have gone to sleep for most of my life.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I didn't see you there. At least, I don't think I did!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: no, yoU woUldnt have.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: my prospit is an alternate version from yoUrs, in a completely different session qUite far afield of yoUr reality.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: if we are ever to meet in person, it is Unlikely to be while playing oUr respective games!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Ok then.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I mentioned this briefly to Jake, and he didn't have much to say before we parted ways.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I will gather that if this is all true, then it means Jake had not awoken yet?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: i think this is for yoU to determine in time. what is yoUr hUnch?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I don't know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: But there was one thing about the dream that was very troubling.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I'm becoming nervous to consider what it might mean.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: Understandable. bUt it will be important to practice patience today.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: yoU have a long road ahead of yoU, and many qUestions will be answered in time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: bUt we can talk it over later. now, we both have games to prepare for!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: i know yoU coUld never fUlly appreciate what this actUally meant, bUt i took mUch care to sync Up these conversations with yoU on the same day that i begin playing as well.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: that way, we can joUrney throUgh oUr sessions together and compare notes! :u</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Hrm. I'm still not sure I appreciate what that means, but I appreciate that a nice gesture has been made if you say so!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I guess I should just start believing all of this now, huh? Rather than learning it to be true later and feeling the fool for all my curmudgeonly skepticism?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: ~_u</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: For starters, I guess I could drop my reservations about your story?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: will yoU :U!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I can write off much to tomfoolery as I'm no stranger to a good prank myself. But quite honestly you seem too kind for this charade. Not the type I'd expect to trot out such persistent falsehoods beyond their humorous welcome.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: So what do I know! Consarn it, maybe you are an alien girl from Uranus, and together we are about to play a game which determines the fate of existence. Sign me up!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: oh, hee hee! bUt i never claimed to be from that planet, which is only in the far reaches of yoUr solar system.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: in fact i am from mUch farther away. a different Universe altogether.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: bUt if yoU trUly mean it, thank yoU for believing me!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: now, jane my lovely, let Us prepare for this adventUre.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: remember what i said aboUt the need for patience.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: patience with yoUr friends. </p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: patience for yoUr growth as a hero of life.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: and patience for the coming of the other foUr of legend.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: a hero of breath and of light and of time and of space!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: and if yoU still find yoUrself in doUbt</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: jUst check the inscription on that big old book downstairs.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: after all, if yoU cant trUst words written by yoUr own hand</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: then what Use is trUst at all? ^u^</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: &lt;kisses!&gt;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">uranianUmbra [UU]</span> ceased cheering <span style=\"color: #00d5f2\">gutsyGumshoe [GG]</span> </p>",
