You landed a little ways over there, a8out where your hive is now. You clo88ered your nanna to death with the aforementioned joke 8ook. 8ut it wasn't your fault. You were 8oth just little wigglers, riding meteors from the future.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: You cre8ted yourself, your nanna, Jade, her grandpa, not to mention Dave and Rose and their guardians, all in a la8 using paradox slime, and sent them 8ack in time as the silly gru8s with arms and legs you call 8a8ies. And here you were dou8ting the usefulness of slime!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: wow, really?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yes, a8solutely.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I paid close attention to all this, 8ecause I thought it might give me some clues a8out us and our ancestors, who were made the same way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Any of this familiar?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: hmm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: that all sounds incredible if true, but i don't have even the foggiest memory of that happening!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yeah. I figured as much.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Since you seem 8ent on staying in your dream 8u88le coma, why don't I continue the tour?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: the tour... of earth?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Sort of.</p>",
