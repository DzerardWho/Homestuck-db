To ascend, each time you must first descend!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: huh. alright. so i guess i scramble around down here until... uh, until what?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: Until you find the next gate. It is hidden somewhere in the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Land</span>.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: ok, so i get to that gate and go in. then what? where does it take me? uh... further up maybe? but i haven't even built that high yet.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: So you see why you had to build in the first place, John? You must have a little faith in your dear old nanna!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: yeah, well, i do nanna but i'm still not really getting it. does the next gate down here take me back up to the house or something?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: (please don't say hoo hoo hoo)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: HOO. HOO HOO.</p>",
