But I don't always understand his motivation for doing the stupid things he does.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHY NOT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I just don't.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Like one time? He sold a girl some potions. I have no idea why he did that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">POTIONS?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yes potions.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">He also threw some corpses into a sprite to revive them, and fused their identities to create a disturbing freak of nature.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I'm still not really sure why he did that. Probably just to fuck with everybody.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT CORPSES.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">It doesn't matter what corpses. Just some corpses, ok?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">The point is, he probably didn't even have any reason for doing it. He was just being weird and capricious.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">But that doesn't mean it didn't end up serving an important purpose anyway.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">After the fused corpse sprite exploded, both of their ghosts got fed up and decided to start working together.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">And now they're doing some important stuff in the afterlife. But I kind of doubt this clown had any idea that would happen.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Or maybe he did? Who really knows with clowns.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">HOLY FUCK. WHO CARES ABOUT THIS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT ABOUT THE CROWBAR.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">What about it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YOU SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">It is important.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">But I don't know if HE knows that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I BET THAT CROWBAR IS A USELESS PIECE OF GARBAGE. I WILL NOT ACCEPT IT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Maybe he heard you bitching about the wireless mouse being welded to the counter, and he's giving you something to pry it off with?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">OH. RIGHT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">MAYBE THAT'S IT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">But that's not why it's important.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THEN WHY.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You know how at the start of an adventure, you find some seemingly trivial thing that turns out to be important later?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">But at the time you have no idea why or how it'll turn out to be important?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YEAH.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">It's like that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN ANYTHING.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">It explains everything.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT'S MAGIC ABOUT IT. WHAT DOES IT DO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I'm not telling.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">TELL ME WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO WITH IT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">No.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YES.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Just take the damn crowbar.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">OK. FINE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I THINK I AM DEVELOPING A PREMONITION.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">ABOUT WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT. AND WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO WITH IT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Really?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YES. IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN REALLY SOON!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I CAN FEEL IT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Wait, what are you...</p>",
