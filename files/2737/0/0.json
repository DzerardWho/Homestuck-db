these questions dude youll find out anyway its not like youll even really need your money</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: you you might as well give it to me</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: uh...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: how much do you need?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: all of it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: oh, fuck that!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: man you just said you thought it was useless why do you care</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: but you just said it wasn't useless!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: ill pay you back</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: really? when?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: in the future</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: if theres one thing im not short on its the fuckin future</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: how far in the future are you from?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i thought we only had something like 24 hours until, like...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: game over.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: yeah we do</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: but chronologically ive been around for at least triple that</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: wow. how...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i don't get how that works!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: no shit your deal is wind not time</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: youre on easy street what is there even to think about with wind</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: like what angle to blow it at to fly a damn kite or how gentle its gotta be to make a picnic go swimmingly</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: its kiddie bullshit time is serious fucking business</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: leave it to the pros ok</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: but, doesn't going back in time make an alternate reality?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i thought that's what happened with dave sprite, he came back to make sure i didn't die and this is a new timeline now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: yeah it can work that way</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: or not</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: ive been very careful</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: this whole operation is strung together with stable time loops</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: no timeline offshoots cause thats when daves start dying and that isnt no good for nobody</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: daves, plural?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: yeah</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: there are a bunch of daves running around the timeline</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: oh, man.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: but they are all me</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: i mean they will all become me and ill become them one way or another</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: thats how stable time loops work shit takes a lot of planning and precise choreography</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: ive got some help though</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: help?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: sounds like you have been talkin' to some trolls!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: yeah</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: they seem to be getting more talkative lately.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: man dont even get me started with that</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: the 24 hour span of the reckoning is like some kind of critical spike in us dealing with troll bullshit</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: i guess its just when the most shit is going down so they figure thats the best time to mess with us</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: yeah, that makes sense.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i guess since you've lived three days in one day, you've just been hassled that much more?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: i dont know man they seem to flock to me</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: ive been laying waste to chumps nonstop</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: its like they heard somebody over here was handing out asses and theyve known nothing but years of bitter ass famine</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: heheh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: so what is the future like?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: or uh, the 3x future...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: do we win???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: oh you know</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: noirs outta control</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: rose is crazy jades crazier and youre</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: well youre you</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: and together were up to our bulges and miscellaneous bullshit alien physiology in hot sloppy shenanigans while hatching plans under our feathery asses like a bunch of cage free farm fresh motherfuckers</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: but im not about to get into specifics cause this is complicated enough as it is</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: and if i started ranting too much about the future id start sounding like one of these smug alternian shitheads and im not about to drop that retarded science on my good bro</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: so im staying on track here</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: speaking of which</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: give me your money</p>\n<p style=\"color:

#0715cd\">EB: tell me what you want with it!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: im working the system here</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: using time loops to manipulate the incipispheres financial sector</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: making a goddamn killing in the lohacse</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: lohacse?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: lohac stock
