It took a little while, and a few lucky guesses on the code digits, 8ut we eventually got there.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Then I just used it to upgrade my much cooler 8 8all modus.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: you hacked my dad's wallet??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Sure. Like I said, we had some time on our hands.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: It is after all just a fucking wallet. It's not like it's some legendary item he got on some mythical dad quest.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I mean, he did 8UY the thing somewhere, right?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: um. yeah, i guess so.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i dunno.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i still think it's a pretty special thing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Nope!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Sorry to 8e the 8earer of 8ad news. It is literally... just a wallet.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Anyway.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Then, 8efore I did the scouting work on this session, I rode the meteor through the g8, watched it crash on Earth, then just captchalogued the whole damn thing and got out of there.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: No sweat!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Presuma8ly like Grim8ark Jade was supposed to, if she wasn't asleep.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Again, it was a pretty good plan, she just never saw me coming.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Sorry Condy, if you want your waterlogged little glo8e 8ack, you'll have to pry it from John's dead hands now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: er.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: ...yeah.</p>",
