What a stunning coincidence you would ask about it now. I am stunned.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: yeah i know!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: what will you make with it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: And who said it was something from which something else could be made?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: well john did tell me what it was duh.....</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I suppose I'll take a stab at learning the craft.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It's the least I can do in response to the subtle dig concealed in his gesture.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: He often tells me I \"need a new hobby\" when I make perfectly reasonable analytical remarks.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: oh but rose i dont think he meant anything like that by it!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: you see not everybody always means the opposite of what they say the way you and dave always do</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Maybe.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: His birthday is in a few months, isn't it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: yep!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i finally finished a present for him</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: ive been working on it for years!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Years?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It's so hard to tell when you're joking.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Or if you're even capable of it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: heheheh.... :)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i just mailed it too so it is sure to get there on time</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: mail takes a while to get anywhere from here!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I'll probably craft something with strong sentimental value.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: That should burn him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i dont think you really mean that!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I guess not.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: So, shall I expect a green package dropped to my house via airmail from whatever screwball cranny of the globe you're tucked into?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: err.......</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: no :(</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: sorry but you are sort of hard shop for &lt;_&lt;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: besides i have something for you today that i think you will like better than some thing in a box!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Oh?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: it is a tip!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: This is already intriguing enough to compensate for the grave scarcity of lavish gifts parachuting from the sky. Please go on.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: did you have a pet a long time ago that died?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: ok well how did you feel about your cat, did you love him a lot?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: \"ok well\", I didn't mention it was a cat, or that it was a male. Let's pretend I'm surprised and you're embarrassed and move on.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: To answer your question, I would describe my feelings toward the animal as lukewarm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: ummmmm ok....</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: thats fine!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: it doesnt really matter i think, just.....</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: what if someone told you you could play a game that would bring him back to life?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: If someone told me that, I would regard the remark with a great deal of skepticism.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: If that someone was you, on the other hand, then I would have to ask preemptively:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Is that someone you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: yes that someone is me!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i just thought you might find it interesting</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: So what is this game?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: oh i dont know</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: im just saying is all</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i think youll hear about it later and maybe you can talk to john and dave about it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: they are way more into all that stuff than i am!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I'll see what the word on the street is about it. In due time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: For now I should probably order a copy of Knitting for Assholes. It would be a shame if I ran late with John's present.</p>",
