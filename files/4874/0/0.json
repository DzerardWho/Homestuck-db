The thought of that was completely disgusting to her.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: But I really would have liked to be able to meet them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I guess some things would just be too awesome to ever stand a chance of happening.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Yeah i know the feeling. :(</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Wait...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: What?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Dirk didnt you tell me at some point that you did find evidence the witch killed them?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: As of now?

I feel weird.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: ...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I guess i am mistaken. Never mind.</p>",
