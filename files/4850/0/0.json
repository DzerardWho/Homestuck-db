I imagine they were just easier to produce and control, since she'd given up hope of perfectly mirroring her own civilization in all its convoluted symbiotic glory.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: But not without a good fight, and not without taking her frustrations out on the human population.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: She attempted to enforce \"blood casting\" through efforts to genetically alter people's blood color. That was an ugly chapter. Lotta fuckin' people died from that debacle.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Over the last four hundred years, the population just got smaller and smaller from these atrocities piling up. But she clearly didn't give a shit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: All the while, the amount of dry land kept shrinking due to the gradual flooding.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Soon there was hardly anywhere left to live, and then, that was that. No more people.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Damn.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Wait...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Flooding?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Oh. Yeah, I probably should have mentioned this up front.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: One of the first things she did while in power was begin melting the ice caps.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It took a while, but eventually the whole world flooded.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: That's how it is now. It's totally soaked up in this bitch.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Wow like the epic kevin costner film?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Almost exactly. Especially by the same degree of shittiness.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh man does that mean you have to drink your own pee??????</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You get used to the taste. Welcome it, even.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: That takes about 15 days in a row of hard piss drinking though.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Ewwwwwwwwwwww no dude. No ew. :(</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Relax, I don't drink any goddamn piss, ok?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh ok. Whew.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I guess your lusis droid thingy sees to it that you have fresh water?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Nope. Those stopped being a thing a long time ago too, once humans went extinct.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh i thought...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Hm. Well who raised you then?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Nobody, man. I raised my damn self.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: !</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Jesus christofer kringlefucker and here i thought i was rugged!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You're still pretty rugged. You're just a fucking dork about it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Thats true.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I guess I did have Cal looking after me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Let's not discount the rad service of the C-man, ok?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Heaven forbid.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: And what about roxy?</p>",
