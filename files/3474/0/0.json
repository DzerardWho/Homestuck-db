I was sure I'd fail, and my lusus would either get angry and eat me, or she'd just die and then I'd 8e culled.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ut then I saw a shooting star one evening.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I tracked down where it landed, and found a chest with my sign on it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: A sign is an insignia we must wear, specific to our class. Each class has a huge alpha8et of signs, so when someone shares yours, you know you have a lot in common. I was so excited to see it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: what was in the chest!</p>",
