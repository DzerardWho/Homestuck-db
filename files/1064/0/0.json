The defaced Cosby poster shares those holes. You determine that the defaced Cosby could only result from a double-punching with the Joker, if your theory is correct. This means the original Cosby poster had one of those holes punched, or the other, or neither, making three total possibilities.\r<br/> <br/>You try out all three possible codes, yielding:\r<br/> <br/>- 1 POTTED PLANT \r<br/>- 1 PAINTING OF A HORSE ATTACKING A FOOTBALL PLAYER \r<br/>- 1 CLEAN COSBY POSTER \r<br/> <br/>SUCCESS.</p>",
