the hell knows at this point?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: i know rite</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: the curious case of the mutual moms</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: it is</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: the biggest mystery?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: u no</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: once i even caught wind of some lore that implied i might even be my OWN mom</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: (fefeta hinted that @ me once during a long spiel DAMN that girl could talk)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: how messed up would that be tho</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: there is probably something to that actually.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: you were all the first batch of babies, after all.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i think you were literal copies of yourselves?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: that's what it supposedly means to be a paradox clone.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: babies</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: wat</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: oh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i guess i kind of glossed over this stuff in my story.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but i was the one who made us all in the first place, with a weird cloning machine.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: no fuckin shit???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: *is impressed*</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: it was no big deal though. i was just messing around with a control panel, and some babies appeared.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: so we already met huh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: and i dont even remember because i was just some idiot bb</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: that aint fair!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: come to think of it, we met one other time too.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but you were asleep.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: ??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: you were floating around in purple pajamas, and i pushed you out of the way of a flying fork.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i almost forgot about that. but yep, that was you alright.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: you shoulda woke me up then</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i might have, but the fork stabbed me in the chest, and dream killed my sleep ghost. or something.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: you know how it is with dream logic.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: u mean how it makes lil 2 no sense ever</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: yes, exactly.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i guess i didn't think much about it at the time, but i had a sneaky suspicion that's who you were.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: you really look a lot like rose.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: she is looking for you, by the way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: yeah?????</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: she told me to go find you. and i did.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: so, she says hi.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: o man</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: what else did she say</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: uh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: she said...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: she's looking forward to meeting you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: awwwwww</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: well if u see her again before i do tell her i cant wait to meet her too</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: though tbh im kinda nervous about it but dont tell her that part haha</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: sure!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: there's nothing to be nervous about though.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: she's just a nice nerd who likes to read and knit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: i shouldnt be surprised to hear that</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: me and all my friends are a bunch of silly nerds too</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: even dirk who thinks hes 2 cool 4 school</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: when in reality he is nowhere close to clearing the coolness threshold which exempts one from attending an educational institution :p</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: speaking of which...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i've been wondering where he is?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i know jade's grandpa is in jail too, getting badgered by my evil nanna...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: u mean jake n jane</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: yes, sorry.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but i have not seen hide nor hair of dave's bro yet.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: i figured he got thrown in jail too</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: although come to think of it i probly would have heard a bloody ruckus by now resulting from his inevitable escape attempt</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: hmm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: im not that worried about him though hes good at takin care of himself</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: in fact i feel like all of us will be ok now that you guys are here</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: but</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: there is still one of my friends im worried about the most</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: who?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: shes my best friend</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: well ok</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: i got a few best friends u know?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: but she was always kind of a special best friend</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: and last time i saw her she was in big trouble</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: oh no.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: where is she?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: in the afterlife</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: being dead</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: ...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: her bro killed her</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: which is bad enough</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: but now hes out there</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: hunting for her ghost</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: shes doing her best to hide</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: but her bro is an awful and relentless piece of shit and im afraid</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: im afraid she might be already gone :(</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: you're right, that is very concerning.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: who is she? would i know of her?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: dunno</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: how in the loop are you on cherubs?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: oh!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: surprisingly, i know a LOT about that subject.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: for instance, did you know they turn into gigantic snakes when they have sex?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: :O</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: :O</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: :O</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i know. weird, right?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: that's probably not very relevant to the topic at hand, though.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: yeah prob not</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: anyway u know about lord english right</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: uh huh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: ok well</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: shes his sister</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: her name is calliope</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: ohhh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: ok, this is starting to make sense.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: yep</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: shes supposed to be critical to defeatin him somehow</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: shes going on some quest out there to find a deadlier version of herself or whatever</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: i dunno that could be all be true...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: and maybe its selfish of me but all i rly care about now is if shes ok??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i understand. she is your friend.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i would feel the same way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: :)</p>\n<p
