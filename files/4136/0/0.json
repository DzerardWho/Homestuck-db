I know this is meant to be a spanking ripsnorter of a day for you and all.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: But do you happen to know where the devilfucking dickens mr strider might be?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Oh, that's fine!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I had been meaning to message you sooner actually, but I suppose in all the hubbub today, it plumb slipped my mind.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Which is a shocking fact on its lonesome, considering what I have to tell you!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Egad...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: *Loosens collar a bit.*</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: As for this Strider business, hrmmm. He's an elusive guy Jake. You know that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I talked to him yesterday. That's as much help as I can be!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Shoot.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I really need to ask him something but hes got his blasted auto responder turned on.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Hoo hoo.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I love that thing. :B</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: He wouldnt be pleased to hear you say that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: What do you need with him?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Does this have to do with your crazy pen pal project?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: It most certainly does and time is of the essence!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Today is the day i have to finish it and send it. Not a day later!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: So you see why i am feeling really friggin discombobulated at the moment.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Sorry, J. :(</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: This would be the birthday present... for your grandmother?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: No!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: It is for your grandfather simply to be *relayed* to him by my grandmother. A joint gift to him from she and i.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Her and me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: What? Who and you now?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: \"A joint gift from her and me.\" Grammar, Jake!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh for frigs flipping sake jane this is no time for your prudish pedantry! Leave your bookish malarkey in a dusty old library somewhere. I have an adventure to get on with!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: So if I have this straight, the big thing hogging up your plate today is not this marvelous new game which I have invited you to play with me, but finishing a robotic rabbit to give to my dead poppop?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Bingo. *double pistols and a wink*</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: You are a very strange and silly boy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Please jane we have addressed this.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I am sending the gift back in time to when they are both alive and about our age.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Or...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Something like that. Something funny is going on here that i have not fully grappled yet but dag nab it if im not gonna see it through.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Well,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Godspeed, then! I do hope you can pull it off.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Are you being fresh with me now?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: No!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Look jane i know youve never believed me and you think everything i say is some big cockamamie goofoff but i think today of all days is when you should start taking some things more seriously.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Especially since i have always had your back. I have always believed in you!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Hey! I have believed in you too.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: However, believing somebody isn't the same thing as believing IN somebody.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: But that much said...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I think that maybe I am getting ready to believe some of the wild stories I've heard?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Or, if not believe outright, reserve judgment on, at least.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Is that so!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I don't know!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I'm still not sure what to think. But what I wanted to tell you this morning was...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I had a really wild dream last night.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: And you were in it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh my. *glasses fog up. fumbles for kerchief.*</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Sh! Not like that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: It was so real! I think we were in the game, even though we haven't started playing yet.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I don't know what to make of it. Whether it was a vision of the future, or somewhere that exists now, or if it was just a really lucid dream due to excitement.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: What was i doing there?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Um...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Not a heck of a lot!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I really want to tell you all about it, but it will take some time to explain, and we both have things to attend to.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: You with your time traveling rabbitwork, and I, my vigilant window gazing!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Too true.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Let us reconvene later and sort out all this shit at a leisurely pace.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Yes, ok, good luck Jake!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Okay you too jane!
