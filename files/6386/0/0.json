#000000\">honestly it has become very tiresome listening to this sort of thing</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">i thought davesprite had problems</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">his issues i could kind of understand</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">i thought you might be different, being the alpha dave and all</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">but no</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">you might be even more messed up inside than he was!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: what</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: why are you dragging that guy into this</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: what happened with you and him anyway</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">none of your business &gt;:p</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: it kind of is</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: hes bird me</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: that clearly means i have a right to know</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">that doesnt make any sense!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: you said he had issues</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: what issues</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">augh!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">forget i mentioned it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: was he talking shit about me the whole time or something</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i know he resents me for being the real dave</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">dont say that, you arent the real dave!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">well you are, but phrasing it like that is so mean!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">hes just as real as you, and when you imply he isnt you sound like a jerk!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: man i knew it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i knew he was poisoning your view of me all those years</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: and i wasnt there to say anything or defend against his slander so now of course you think im a neurotic douche</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">THE ONLY REASON I THINK YOURE A NEUROTIC DOUCHE IS BECAUSE YOURE ACTING LIKE ONE NOW!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yeah but i only started acting like a neurotic douche like half way through this conversation</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: you clearly had an axe to grind with me from the start and i want to know why</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: what did i ever do to deserve this shit from you</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">YOU BROKE MY HEART!!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: what</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i did</p>\n<p

#000000\">davesprite did</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">BUT YOURE BASICALLY THE SAME GUY!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: whoa no way</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: thats such an unfair characterization we are completely different dudes</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">you just said you had a right to know what happened between us because, and i quote, \"hes bird me\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: no i know</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i was playing the \"hes bird me\" card because it was convenient to whatever it was i was saying at the time</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i forget what point i was making when i said that</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">*growl*</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but thats not the point im making now</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: he and me are

lays eggs out of the same ghostly hole</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: ...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: ew man whyd i have to go there</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">*SNARL*</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: ok if he broke up with you or whatever that was because of his dumb bird issues not my issues</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: theres no way i would have done that to you</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: my issues are totally different and probably way more serious</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i dont see anyone ordering him to master time travel or trying to pawn brittle welsh swords off on him do you</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: nobody is telling him hes got to murder the incredible hulk</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: did you tell him hes got to murder the incredible hulk jade</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: no i think not</p>\n<p style=\"color:
