THE PAJAMA PRODIGY USED HIS PUZZLE SPONGE TODAY.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: BESIDES, JADE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OTHER IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE PLAN.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: FOR ONE THING, YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR HER TO SEND YOU THE CODE FOR THE QUILLS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: YOU CAN'T SCRATCH THE MESA WITHOUT THEM.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: SHE GOT THEM FROM HER DENIZEN, OR WILL LATER ON HER TIMELINE, NOW THAT SHE LIT THE FORGE AND WOKE THE MONSTER UP.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: aren't those the really tough to kill guys?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: YEAH</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: did she kill him?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: HELL IF I KNOW, HER EXPLANATION OF THE ENTIRE ENCOUNTER BOILED DOWN TO AND I QUOTE \"</span><span style=\"color: #4ac925\">shenanigans</span><span style=\"color: #626262\">\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: LIMED FOR INFURIATINGLY VAGUE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: haha.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: ANYWAY, AFTER SHE GIVES THAT TO YOU, SHE THEN HAS TO GO THROUGH WITH THE REST OF THE PLAN, WHICH IS MAKING SURE YOU ALL SURVIVE AFTER THE SCRATCH, MINUS ONE OF THE DERSE DREAMERS OF COURSE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: THE PLAN REVOLVES AROUND SOME REALLY BAFFLING HAND WAVEY MUMBO JUMBO WHICH I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND, BUT SHE TOLD ME TO TRUST HER ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE INFO COMES FROM A \"</span><span style=\"color: #ffffff\">Reliable informant.</span><span style=\"color: #626262\">\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: WHITENED FOR SMUG TOOL.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: IT INVOLVES SOMETHING TO DO WITH A YELLOW LAWN RING.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: WHICH ISN'T THE HUMAN WORD FOR IT, IT'S JUST YOUR WORD IS SO DUMB I FEEL DUMB SAYING IT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: word for what?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: I GUESS YOUR ENTIRE ESCAPE PLAN SOMEHOW PIVOTS CRITICALLY AROUND AN UNWATERED PIECE OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT MEANS. JADE SAYS SHE HAS THIS FIGURED OUT, AND I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO MUCH BUT TRUST HER.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: THE POINT IS, SHE'S ALL BOOKED UP, AND ALL TOO MORTAL. SO SHE WON'T BE DELIVERING THE BOMB, AND NEITHER WILL YOU.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: ok, well what about this.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: since she is mortal, and i am not (sort of), and i don't need to do the scratch for a while, can i go help her?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: maybe she could use some protection? maybe that is what dave was just trying to do, when he temporarily died.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: remember, jack is still on the loose! he has killed rose and dave once, and me twice.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: NO NO NO NO NO NO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: SWEET BLEEDING JEGUS, EGBERT, YOU KEEP BRAGGING ABOUT YOUR IMMORTALITY, AND THEN BRAINLESSLY ANNOUNCE PLANS TO GO OFF AND DO SOMETHING HEROIC!

IT WASN'T UNTIL I WAS TALKING TO HER IN THOSE TIMEFRAMES AND SHE TOLD ME. HE JUST KEEPS FOLLOWING HER AROUND. I CAN SEE HIM OFF IN THE DISTANCE IN SOME FRAMES, JUST LURKING THERE, SHADOWING HER MOVEMENTS. IT'S INCREDIBLY DISTURBING.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: HE LINGERS AROUND HER UNTIL THE SCRATCH BEGINS AND I LOSE THE FEED, NEVER ONCE DOING ANYTHING THREATENING. SHE SAYS SHE THINKS IT'S BECAUSE JACK INHERITED LOYALTY OF HER LUSUS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: IF SHE'S RIGHT, I GUESS HER LUSUS REALLY DID OFFER HER THE MOST PROTECTION POSSIBLE BY PROTOTYPING ITSELF, ALBEIT BY DOOMING US ALL.
