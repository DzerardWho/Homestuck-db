I sent the parts.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Or, correction, DS sent them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You then assembled it. You were therefore complicit in your own spectacular, daily humiliations.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Yeah whatever.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You wanted somebody to wrestle with. DS was being a kickass bro if you ask me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I didn't expect it to be nigh impossible to spar with!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You know damn well there are adjustable difficulty settings.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I have always recommending setting it to Novice, as has DS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Ive tried that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Yeah?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Its just...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Well...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: When hes pulling punches...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: And taking it all easy and such...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: And we start wrestling up a storm and whatnot...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Umm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: What.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Its just that the whole proceeding seems to become...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: A bit tender for my liking.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I don't understand.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Isn't that what you want from a Novice setting?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Sparring with minimal discomfort?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: No i know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Its all fine and dandy martially speaking.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Just the way he...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Sort of...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Man its so awkward trying to convey this just never mind.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: No, I think I get it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You're saying you were somehow dissatisfied within the presence of my robotic avatar's personal space.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Was there an odor problem? Was the metal too hot to the touch?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Help me out.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: No no.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Really never mind!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: This is bullshit, Jake.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: We had a pact. You were gonna tiptoe all the fuck around my brittle feelings. Totally mind the shit out of those eggshell riddled motherfuckers.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh come on dude.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: What does the guy have to do, Jake?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You want to wrestle. He's fucking game. Just a man, a machine, a secluded tropical island. Sounds like you died and went to fucking heaven, if you ask me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Seriously, what does this simple, loyal brobot have to do to prove his worth to you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: What does he have to do to make you at ease with the alkaline sting of his gentle robogrope? I really want to know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Maybe he should just rip his heart out of his chest and pound it into green gravel there in the jungle with his hella strong robot arm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Invoke_Onomatopoeia(Pound * some ridiculously precise value retrieved at astonishing speed from my rad neural net);</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Check it out, little green rocks all over the goddamn place. More than you could ever hope to cram in a shoddy metal rabbit, or any other pliable orifice which might be convenient.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Because clearly its up to a soulless droid to feel emotions for the both of us, you callous, corporeal carbon ape, all trotting around with your fancy fuckin' DNA and shit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: ...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: But gosh does your prose ever make a fella feel uncomfortable.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Brose.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh right. My mistake.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You know what, I've just decided.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: If the brobot's Novice setting makes you uneasy, I'm going to disable it remotely.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Done.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Now you got nothing to worry about.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Awww maaaan!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: But now hell be impossible!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Happy hunting, Jake.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Fuckin.......</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: SHUCKS buster. :(</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">timaeusTestified [TT]</span> ceased pestering <span style=\"color: #1f9400\">golgothasTerror [GT]</p>",
