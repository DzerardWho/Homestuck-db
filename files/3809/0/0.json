At that moment, I was busy hosting you from the future, who is you right now, but I did not mention this at the time. I would have introduced your past self to your future self and vice versa, but it is a well known fact that past and future selves tend not to get along. A good host would never tolerate the potential for discord among guests, and as hosts go, I am simply the best there is. \r<br/> <br/>Please don't be alarmed. Past you was just leaving.\r<br/> <br/>Where was I? </p>",
