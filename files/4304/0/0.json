and the sessions that created them, as well as the sessions created within them</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: including the trolls universe and their session</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: think of it like a giant solar system, but instead of planets revolving around the sun, there are many universes</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: uh, ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: that sounds...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: big.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: it is!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: so, bec was able to teleport anywhere in the universe he wanted in an instant, much faster than light</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: jack was able to do this too, within our session, and then when i inherited those powers from jadesprite, so could i</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: but we could only teleport locally</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: which means, bec could jump to anywhere in our universe, but not to another universe, or into a session</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: and jack could jump to anywhere in our session, but not outside it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: we cant even jump to the green sun itself, even though we sort of serve as a gateway to it, and all its energy</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: and once we leave the suns domain, our travel is limited by the speed of light, like everyone else!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: for example, the furthest ring is not in the suns domain</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: it is more like the suns medium, allowing it to exist</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: so if i wanted to fly out of our session and travel to the green sun, i would have to make my way there through the furthest ring at the speed of light or less</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: and wherever we are now is not in the suns domain either</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: so the same rules apply</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i see.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: it didn't really occur to me this was all so elaborate.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: like, if the green sun is at the center of a bunch of universes, like a huge solar system...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: doesn't that mean it was sort of important?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: maybe trying to blow it up wasn't such a great idea.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: yes i think youre right</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: but to be fair, we were all the victims of a big prank!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: oh man, a prank??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: who pranked us?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: some really creepy omniscient guy</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: it doesnt matter much, hes supposedly dead now</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: oh. well that was quite a ruse then. that son of a bitch!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: yes, but its not all as bad as it seems</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: theres a silver lining in all of this</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: like you said, a sun presiding over many universes has to be pretty cosmically important</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: who knows what terrible consequences there would be if it was destroyed</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: or maybe worse, if it never existed at all</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: which is what made rose and daves true mission an unintended success!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: their true mission?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: what was that?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: to deliver the bomb to the empty location the green sun was meant to exist for most of eternity</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: and then create the sun in the first place</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: that is what the tumor was for all along</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: ...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: like i said</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: we got played like a bunch of suckers!!!</p>",
