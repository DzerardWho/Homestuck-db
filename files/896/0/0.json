They are the defenders of the light of knowledge, free communication, and the exchange of ideas. They are the bold toters of all those little papery conduits of freedom, the white postmarked angels that whisper a message on their deliverance, a promise to the yearning: \"There is hope yet.\" \r<br/> <br/>Liberty. Reason. Justice. Civility. Edification. Perfection.\r<br/><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"> <br/><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">MAIL.</span></span></p>",
