The LAST thing I give a shit about is my stupid \"sweet sixteen\".</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: What a farce. I was trying to act as if we were all living normal well adjusted lives, albeit in a marvelous fantasy setting populated by skeletons.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: And if only we just had some cake and wore some hats and I blew out all the candles in one big puff, we could pretend all the problems we had with each other would magically stop existing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: And the most horrifying thing of all is, I actually got my wish!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Haha. Thanks, Calliope.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Oh well. I'm sure she had good intentions.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Yeah.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I still think I've been pretty lousy to you. I had my head up my ass for a while there.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: By the time your birthday came around, I was kinda freaking out about Jake.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I thought I had the situation under control. But I didn't. Not just with Jake, but with respect to pretty much everything.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I understand.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Boy, you really let him have it back there!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I guess so.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I had a similar meltdown with him earlier. I'm not going to lie. It felt really good.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Heh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: At least, it did at the time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I only wish I could have stayed as lucid as you during our...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Transformation.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: How did you manage that?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It wasn't on purpose. Actually if I had a choice, I probably would have just said, fuck it. Sugar shock my brain, please.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Suffice to say, I have trouble escaping from myself. It's kind of a problem. Let's not talk about it though. Please continue.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Okay.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: So instead of keeping my cool like you, I just started gushing over him like a lovestruck loon, surrendering any sliver of dignity I might have earned by telling him off earlier.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I just cannot believe some of the things I said. Oh God. I told him I wanted to get married and have babies!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Yeah but to be fair, by the time you came looking for me, all three of you were saying that to anything that moved.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I know! But...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: It's one thing to write off something you say to an altered state of mind. But what makes the admission so mortifying to me is...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I actually MEANT it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: And I'm sure he must know that by now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: And now I feel so humiliated I just want to die.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I would ask him to shoot me right here, if I could bring myself to say a word to him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Somehow I don't think he's up to the task.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Which is doubly unfortunate, since that's literally what we all came here to do.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Speaking personally, I'd probably run this sword through my own dick before I could bring myself to kill Roxy. Even for her own good.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: So.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: When the chips are down, I guess that's how much of a badass I really am.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Woo!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: We are all such WINNERS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Yeah, our moxie's off the fuckin' charts.</p>",
