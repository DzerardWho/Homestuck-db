You can plainly see he is conducting some rather serious business with his mobile device. \r<br/> <br/>The network restricts access to within Derse only, so he can't contact the Nobles and do anything sneaky. But at his request you have set up a kingdom-wide network to trade online tips with other Dersites pertaining to his interests.
