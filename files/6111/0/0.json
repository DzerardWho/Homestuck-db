FUZZY.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">AND SQUISHY.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">What?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">LIKE PLUSH.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YOU KNOW.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">LIKE A GOD DAMN PUPPET.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Hold on.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Are you telling me these fuckers are literally made of felt???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT'S FELT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">It's the fabric they put on pool tables.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Kind of soft and fuzzy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">OH. THEN YES.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">EXACTLY LIKE THAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Well that's weird.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I guess you learn something new every day.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Speaking of which, I suppose you'll want me to tell you what these two frog puppets can do?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NO!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">No?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THE ABILITIES OF PURPLE STRIPE HAT. AND ORANGE STRIPE HAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">ARE AS PLAINLY SELF EVIDENT. AS THEY ARE IDIOTIC.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Patience.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">In time, you will grow to love them as if they were two very special sons.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NO WAY.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yes you will.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I can tell you kind of like them already, but you're just pretending you don't to be cool. Like you always do with members of your dark carnival.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I notice you aren't actually trying very hard to escape from the crowd there.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Looks to me like you're enjoying your time in the puppet mosh pit, frankly.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">SCREW YOU!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I'm going to tell you their powers anyway.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NO!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Purple stripe hat has an egg timer juju which makes him time travel whenever it rings.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">But he's too stupid to use time travel sensibly so he ends up making way too many copies of himself.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Orange stripe hat has a magic oven which he can hide inside.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">And that's it. It serves no purpose other than that. Also he's just as dumb as Eggs.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I mean purple stripe hat. Forget I called him that again.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Also pretend I didn't call the other guy Biscuits.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YOU DIDN'T CALL ANYONE BISCUITS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I didn't?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Oh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Damn.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Then pretend I didn't say I did.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I DON'T CARE!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY OF THIS!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">ALL OF THAT WAS OBVIOUS!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I HAVE GROWN WEARY. OF YOUR EXCESSIVE DIVULGENCES!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yeah, my divulgences haven't been too popular lately.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I can't seem to catch a 8r8k.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">A WHAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">A 8r8k.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT'S A 8R8K.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Nothing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Just something an old flame used to say a lot.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Well, not so much an old flame as someone who callously spurned my extraordinarily inappropriate advances one time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">She really blew it though. She could have been the star again, if only she said yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Things are pretty passive aggressive between us now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">WOMEN. Am I right?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NO, DON'T DO THIS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I DON'T WANT US TO BOND OVER YOUR FEMALE PROBLEMS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">STOP TRYING TO BE BROS WITH ME!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You know how it is.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Sometimes a guy just wants to take a look at what an adorable salamander is up to, and scrutinize that situation carefully.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Like really see what's <span style=\"font-style: italic\">going on with that</span>, you know?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Is that so wrong.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">So what if I want to watch a young salamander spend several hours naming skeletons?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">It's my right to do that. I should be able to watch Bubbles name a million fucking skeletons if I want.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I should be able to do that without a spiteful attention hog stealing back the spotlight while she does something \"important\".</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Who cares about important stuff?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Important stuff is so overrated, IMHO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I STOPPED LISTENING!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. BECAUSE I'M NOT READING IT ANYMORE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND BABBLE ALL YOU WANT. ABOUT MEANINGLESS TRASH.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I'VE TOTALLY CHECKED OUT OF THE CONVERSATION. SO BYE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I wonder what Spades Slick is doing right now.</p>",
