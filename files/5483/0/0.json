IS HOW TO RECEIVE HUNDREDS OF BULLETS THROUGH THE TORSO. IN THE LEAST DIGNIFIED MANNER POSSIBLE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">AND ALSO. A CRASH COURSE IN DYING A PAINFUL DEATH. HOPEFULLY.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Sorry to disappoint you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">He's not dead.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">WHAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">What did you expect? He's clearly a god tier.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">BULLSHIT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Haven't you ever seen a god tier before?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You do know what that is, right?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">YES, I KNOW WHAT THAT IS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Then you know he's immortal, and can only die under very specific circumstances.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Guess there's no point in trying to kill him!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">BUT HIS WINGS FELL OFF!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">I SAW THEM FALL OFF.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Hmm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yeah. I guess they did.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">So?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">SO. I THINK. HE'S PROBABLY FAKING.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Oh please. Paranoid much??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Why would anyone go to that kind of trouble? What would be the point?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">He would have to be such a jackass to do that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">I DON'T KNOW WHY HE'S FAKING.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">I JUST KNOW THOSE WINGS WERE BOGUS PIECES OF SHIT. THAT WERE LIKE. STRAPPED ON.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">WHICH MEANS. HE IS A FRAUD.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">If you don't believe me, just see for yourself.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">HUH?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You made the rookie mistake of turning your back on the body.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">OH MY GOD.</p>",
