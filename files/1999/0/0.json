To retrieve it, you'll need to hack the code to open the CARD VAULT left behind.\r<br/> <br/>This will obviously prove to be a completely ridiculous and untenable way of managing an inventory, and lead to a great many follies. Later on, you would swap your modus with your hacker friend, a guy who unlike you happens to be competent with programming. It would only make sense.\r<br/> <br/>But for the time being it makes your life kind of a nightmare. There are so many stupid things that happen because of this modus. So many, you just have no idea.</p>",
