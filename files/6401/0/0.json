Those cool new cartridge features have exploded on to your desktop computer once again! Now we're talking. This is some serious Web 2.0 shit, right here. Maybe even... Web 3.0, dare you say? No, let's not get carried away. Hold the phone. Looks like this piece of shit is still broken. Who is surprised by this? The answer is nobody.\r<br/> <br/>At least the third and final option is probably available now. Let's see what Rose and Terezi are up to.\r<br/> <br/>What? What do you you mean it doesn't work. Are you sure? Try it again.\r<br/> <br/>You're kidding. No, that can't be right.\r<br/> <br/>Only the first option is working?
