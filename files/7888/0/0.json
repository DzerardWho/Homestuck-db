up soon?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: i feel like my friends are probably going to need me</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: you can't wake up just yet.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: why?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: it's not time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: not where your physical form is, at least.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: where my physical form is?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: then...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: what about here?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: what about here?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: argh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: sorry</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: this time stuff is really confusing</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: you're a space player.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: yeah</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: i mean</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: if its not the right time to wake up where im sleeping...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: how long do i have to wait HERE in order to wake up?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: the correlation between the passage of time in the furthest ring and any given physical location is tenuous.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: the measurement of time here is inseparable from the physical passage through its knotted space.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: those two aspects are closely woven together here, to such an extent that they are barely separable.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: all aspects are.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: really?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: all of them??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: i understand how this place has time and space of course.... even if they work together weirdly</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: but</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: i dont see any of the others</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: one doesn't see abstractions.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: not directly.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: ...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: oh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: each opposing pair is in balance throughout this field so as to form a stable canvas.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: though the canvas becomes less stable with each crack in the field, ordinarily one would never directly observe its constituent forces.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: the canvas would seem smooth from afar, but up close, as it were, the tapestry is circuitously woven.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: the aspects, while remaining in balance, interfere with each other. they interlock and intertwine.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: so neither space nor time functions linearly, nor are they conventionally measurable.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: wow</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: i am not sure i totally understand...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: but that is pretty interesting!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: you are predisposed to find the nuances of space intriguing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: and since its opposing aspect is more related than you perhaps have realized, the challenges of understanding it are more compelling to you than you realize as well.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: yeah i guess so</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: physics are all about space and time and such which are fun to think about</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: i like all that stuff!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: so youre saying space and time... and all other aspects i guess... are more closely related here than in like</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: umm...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: more stable places, like my universe?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: they are less distinct from each other here, yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: you said passage of time is inseparable from...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: traveling through space?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: so if we were holding still</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: time wouldnt be moving either?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: that is correct, in a way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: though motion itself is not the absolute process it is in a more conventional medium.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: the measurement of motion requires stable features for comparison.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: of which there are very few in the furthest ring, typically.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: the more cracks that appear, ironically, the more the ring begins to stabilize, at least in a spatial and temporal sense.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: i see</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: so</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: if the cracks werent there</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: how...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: how would we be able to tell if we were moving?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: motion through the twisted space is not gauged by passing landmarks, but anchored to a particular destination.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: destination is an idea maintained by the traveler.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: ideas are subtle composites of various aspects.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: without clear understanding of destination, motion becomes less discernible.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: with less discernible motion, passage of time becomes less measurable.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: at a standstill, time loses meaning, and can seem to stretch on forever, as all events throughout reality swirl around you in no particular order.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: one becomes isolated from all else. imprisoned by inertia.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: hmmmm</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: that is pretty cool too</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: i love spacey stuff!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: you talk about it in a neat way</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: it kinda seems like you are trying to educate me on this</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: like a teacher or something :)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff0000\">CALLIOPE: of course that is what i'm doing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: oh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: heh</span> </p>",
