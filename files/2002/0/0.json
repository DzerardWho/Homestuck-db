Its logic is composed of nothing but infinite loops, or at best, loops of effectively interminable construction.\r<br/> <br/>The above page in the intro section documents the simplest possible ~ATH code structure. Any code deviating from this basic structure will not compile.\r<br/> <br/>You have a whole bunch of code samples you've been messing around with on your computer. It's been frustrating at best, and debilitating to your machine at worst.</p>",
