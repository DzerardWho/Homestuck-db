TIA.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: But yeah.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I don't know if you just want a little solitude.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Or if maybe you finally just got like,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: A case of Strider fatigue.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I could understand that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I mean, not to get all neurotic on you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I'm just saying I get it, if that's what's going on.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: But for real, if you gotta sneak away for a few days, that's cool.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Just might be kind of dope if you at least would let me know which planet you scurried off to.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: And by dope I guess I mean considerate?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Really not trying to be a drag here.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Wondering what's up is all.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Want to meet up soon?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I found a really promising tomb we could raid.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Looks like it runs hella deep.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: If I've got the specs right, could run as deep as the Lion's Mouth itself.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: But without all the fuckin' fire to deal with.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Wait, I mean <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Lion's Mouth</span>.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Gotta underline that key shit. Always forget.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Figure it should take a couple days to make it to the bottom.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Only a day if we both go limp and just fall the whole way down the stairs.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Ignoring literally every sage warning we've ever received about those treacherous plummetation zigzags.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Just tumbling on down in a floppy limbed trance like a couple of puppets in a race arranged by some drunk gamblers.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: If you're into another expedition, head to LOTAK and hit me up. Just don't forget your mask this time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: The deeper we go, the worse it gets, remember?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Could be some unreal grist down there.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: More puzzle shit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Loads of skeletons.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Pack your guns dog.</p>",
