Volcanoes will erupt.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: uuh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: What I'm saying is, it's going to be a scene, and bystanders need to brace themselves.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: ok</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: about when is the big scene happenin</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Probably after the game begins.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I expect he'll hold off on playing his hand until he and Jake are in the session.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: He's taken certain measures.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: For some reason, I think he's latched on to this notion that functioning as the client for a player is customarily a one way pass to makeout city with that player.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Everything with him, and me, is a matter of assiduous tactical forethought. Makin' a play to get his jones on for the J-man is no different.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: not sure what any of this quiet means but it sounds spactacular</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: i cant wait</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: tho im still kinda torn</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: about how 2 feel about his chances vs janes chances</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: what do i say to jane about this???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: its hard being as totey sweet a friend as me</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: its hard and no 1 understanks</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: *lul</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Sorry to hear that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: As ever, I remain an automatonous and dispassionate witness of the oddity that is human interaction, while maintaining no investment in either outcome.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: yeah bs</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: anyway looks like i have to go</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: i have to proves some shit to jane</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Prove what?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: oh u know</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: just subjectin shit to the old madrigogs</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: It seems you just said madrigogs.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: What are madrigogs.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: XD</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: l7r bro</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">tipsyGnostalgic [TG]</span> ceased pestering <span style=\"color: #e00707\">timaeusTestified [TT]</span> </p>",
