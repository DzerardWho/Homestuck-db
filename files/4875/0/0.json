Good plan.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Um.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Anyhoo thats a heck of a tragic and thrilling tale dirk.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I am still totally cockeyed and catawampus about it all i dont even know what to think.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: But you believe me, right?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh yeah every word of it!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Wow.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Why shouldnt i? You are my friend and i trust you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I still just think it's impressive, is all. Even after all this time. You are pretty much a one of a kind dude.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Heh not really i just like believing stuff and believing in people.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Wait what do you mean?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: About what?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: When you said after all this time?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: You just told me now!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Hang on.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Blarg! The deja vuey shit is happening again!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Okay i am SURE weve had this conversation before so many things are familiar.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I remember you saying the one of a kind dude thing and i remember saying the word catawampus and...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: All of it!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Whats going on?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Took you long enough to figure it out.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Pages really are a slow burning class. Damn.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Figure what out!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You're asleep.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Thats right. I fell off the platform thing and i guess i got knocked out?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Yep.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: So im dreaming.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Kinda.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It's a dream bubble.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Whats that?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: A place in the infinite abyss where sleeping people can share dreams with each other while revisiting memories.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Also where they can meet dead people.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: So we are sharing a dream together?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: And youre currently asleep too? Uh. Currently in the future?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: No.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Even if I was, I wouldn't visit a dream bubble. That only happens when your dream self is dead, like yours is.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Mine is not.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Hm. I guess i understand?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: So whats the deal then? Wait.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: You said this is where they meet dead people too...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Shit! Dirk are you dead? Are you a ghost!?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: No, dude. Chill. I'm fine.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Then what the fuck is going on! Who am i talking to?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Well, who are the people you talk to when you have a regular dream?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: What? Uh...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Like just a boring normal dream, and there's a person you're talking to. Who is that?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I dont know?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It's nobody. Just a projection of your own mind.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Dream bubbles don't always need to be shared by dreamers or dead people. You can go to sleep and wake up in one alone, reliving an old memory.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Kind of like a normal dream. Until you remember it's just a memory, which is where we are now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Okay.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: So.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I am having like a lucid dreamy thing in a magic bubble and you are just like a figment of my imagination?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Yes, basically.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: So im talking to myself! Thats kind of stupid!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Well, yeah. But not quite.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You could view me as a projection of the real Dirk within your mind, as expressed through all of your thought patterns about him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: So I'm kind of a splinter of his corporeal self who happens to live in your awareness.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I'm a startlingly close approximation to the real thing, for all intents and purposes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Just how startlingly close are we talking?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I'm not going to give you a bogus percentage like the glasses cause that's not my shtick.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: But pretty damn close.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Okay thats fair.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: But.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Man.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: There is something that feels kind of weird about this. You being in my head... its a little messed up!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: What's messed up about it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You were the one who put me here, with your intimate understanding of all his mannerisms and predilections.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: And a splintered existence is pretty much how he rolls.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: This is how shit is bro.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Ok im sorry for saying its messed up but...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Its still a bit frustrating! Ive been trying to talk to you all day.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: But all i get is your pesky responder bedeviling me at every turn and your friggin robot punching me across the ocean and then throwing a weird tantrum and ripping his nuclear heart out in front of me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: And if that werent enough i tumbled off the doohickey and knocked myself out and now im strolling down memory lane with your fake brain ghost!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Its like you are surrounding me from all sides with imitations of yourself but never the REAL YOU!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Cheese and fucking crackers when do i just get to talk to the actual dirk?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Jake, what do you even know about someone's actual self?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: What makes it actual? What is \"actuality?\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: What a horseshitty question!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I dont know anything about actuality i guess but i know some philosobabble horseshit when i dadblasted hear it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I'm just saying, this isn't really your field of expertise.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Dirk is the heart guy. He's the one walking the path of self, even when he doesn't know it. Like right now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: But what does that mean?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: And how can you really be made of only my thoughts when i dont even know what youre talking about sometimes?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Or when i didnt know some of the things youre telling me? Like about being in a dream bubble?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: How can i tell myself about that stuff through brain ghost dirk!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Who says you don't know those things on some level?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I dont think i do!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I have no business knowing those things.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Pages have a lot of untapped potential.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: That's practically all there is to the class, actually.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: But when they eventually find it, look out.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: And the ones who deal in hope? Shit, man.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I'm scared of you already, and I'm not even real.</p>",
