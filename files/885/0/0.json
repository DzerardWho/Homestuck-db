You ought to give it a read when you have a moment. Particularly the first several pages!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: ok nanna, i will.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: hey, nanna?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: Yes, dear?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: since i am trying to get up to that gate, and since you can sort of conjure floating beds and throw me around and all...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: couldn't you just throw me up to the gate?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: Yes, of course, John!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: But that would not serve your purpose well!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: There is a very good reason why you should build up to it. And then keep building!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: oh, ok, i guess that's what i figured.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: so just one more thing...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: do you think that instead of telling me exactly why that is with a clear explanation, you can give me a series of really coy riddles about it and then sort of giggle?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: John, you are a very fresh young man!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: Your father has done such a wonderful job raising you. I am so proud of you both.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: ha ha, i guess.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: When you pass through the first gate, everything will change. You will find the place where the constellations dance beneath the clouds. And then your true work may begin.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: Hoo hoo hoo!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i suddenly understand everything!</p>",
