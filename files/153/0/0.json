You will need to install the server application.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: You should have received both in separate envelopes. I am running both on my computer right now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: what??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Did you get another envelope in the mail?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: no!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Once you install the server and establish a connection, I'm sure you will be able to manipulate my environment in the same manner.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Are you sure you didn't get it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: oh man.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i think i might know where it is.</p>",
