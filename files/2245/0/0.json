Not much point in living with all these moaning spooks just to spite some guy you don't give a shit about.\r<br/> <br/>But how to go about it? Can't control her. It can be difficult to manipulate the mind of the psychically gifted.\r<br/> <br/>Let's see, who else is there. Terezi? Forget about it! What about that guy? Nah. Her? Nope. Not him either. \r<br/> <br/>How about this guy? Unfortunately, you can only control him about half the time.\r<br/> <br/>Then again, that should be all the time you need.</p>",
