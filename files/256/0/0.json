But I've determined your neighborhood was destroyed by the meteor. Wherever you were transported, it saved you from the impact.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I've been reading reports in the news. Over the last few days, there have been many smaller meteor collisions with people's homes around the world.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: And they seem to be getting bigger. Yours was the biggest they've identified so far.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: wow, ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: so then i guess if this is all the game's doing, then the point is for us to save the world?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Perhaps.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: then we'd better get moving and figure this game out!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Yes, but wait.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: We should retrieve your PDA. Yet again.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It will help to keep tabs on each other while you investigate.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I think I can get you closer to it, if I can replenish our grist supply somewhat.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: There may be a way to recycle some that we already used.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I'll meet you out on the balcony.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: wait, rose! one thing...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: What?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: you never even wished me a happy birthday!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: um... hello?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I was working on something to send you, but I was running late with it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I didn't want you to think I believed meager well wishes alone would suffice for the occasion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: That said, happy birthday, John.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: haha, oh jeez, that is silly!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: anyway, thanks!</p>",
