You were practically raised by that puppet. He was a much better guardian to you than that Hollywood superstar BRO of yours ever was. He is such a good listener. You share with him all your most private thoughts and hopes and dreams, and sometimes you snuggle up with him for a nice nap.\r<br/> <br/>Anyway, the bottom line is, puppets are awesome. \r<br/> <br/>And that's really all there is to say on the matter.</p>",
