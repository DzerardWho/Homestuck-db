What a shame. Those exciting new gameplay features were looking real slick, too. You think it was pretty neat how the panels were sliding around like that. Oh well, you probably didn't miss all that much. \r<br/> <br/>Nevertheless, on a hunch you navigate once again to your trusty <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/colours-and-mayhem-universe-a\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp page</a>, and check the length of the song in question. Your fears are confirmed. It seems you missed four solid minutes of footage.
