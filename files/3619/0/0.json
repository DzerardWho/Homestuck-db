Stop it.\r<br/> <br/>Jack.\r<br/> <br/>Slick?\r<br/> <br/>Which would you prefer I call you? It's one of the strange points of uncertainty which surrounds you. Maybe it is that you don't particularly care. Your flair is for the plain and serviceable, isn't it? Not much of your vanity is tied up in a name, I'd guess.\r<br/> <br/>Not going to tell me? Fine, I won't tell you my name either.\r<br/> <br/>Well, I might. If you would just show some manners and stop hitting me with that ridiculous horse hitcher. I won't crack no matter how senseless the drubbing. If only it were that simple.\r<br/> <br/>You're not going to stop, are you. It will be very difficult to discuss our points of mutual interest like this. I was prepared to go about it in a civilized way, even though I knew very well I would spend the first several minutes of our meeting sitting on the floor while being flogged. I have even prepared a bowl of candy for you, which I know you will enjoy. Courtesy is important, Jack.\r<br/> <br/>Do you have anything at all to say? Any form of communication you care to attempt beyond the sound iron makes against my head repeatedly?\r<br/> <br/>No, of course not.</span>]</p>",
