The blue flicker of the coat's lining is arresting. But you don't know it's a coat. That would only invite more questions. You don't know what it shields. Nor do you know whose shoulders it was meant to cover. If you knew that - if you even knew his name - you would understand terror no human ever has.\r<br/> <br/>You should really listen to Karkat and turn it off. If you start messing with it, I will seriously start fucking everything up. It would be irresponsible of both of us to let that happen.\r<br/> <br/>You suddenly wonder where Jadesprite went. You wonder that because I said you did. I know where she went. But I will not say.\r<br/> <br/>Not that you can hear a word I'm saying.\r<br/> <br/>The coat's too thick.</p>",
