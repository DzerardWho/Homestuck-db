John's hot mom.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> It wasn't a Freudian slip that time I said it deliberately. :3</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: Kill.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: Me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> We phantasmal kittyfolk don't have much use for disguising the thoughts we think to be true in our minds nor do we bother to veil attraction to that which we find sexually appealing! Meow.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">JANE: :O</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> These IDEAS I'm having mmrrr they're so *interesting*. Wherever this frame of reference has been all my life color me glad I'm dead!!! ;3</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> John's hot mom did you know you killed me?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> No not the girl the cat I mean. You were twice culpable in a way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> The murder weapon was in your custody and bequeathed to you roundaboutedly by you yourself as an aged ghostly grannywoman.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> The plummet of that gut-crushing tome was the last thing I ever witnessed.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> Of course the old woman herself was murdered by the accursed thing too so one could hardly blame her for pulling a few strings here and there that it might find another victim.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> When a bedeviled joke opus is taken with certain individuals it can be difficult to wrest them away from its favor.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> Mrow look at me boring you all with elementary tome trivia everyone knows already. What is this the kitten corner?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> The fact is John's hot mom one time you and your cornball book made a pussy pancake out of me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: :O</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> I suppose Roxy had a hand in it too technically though it seems mom had it in her blood to do well intended harm to that poor critter I used to be.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> It's ok though because she makes up for it with the BEST funerals!!! Purrr they are a treat, each of my halves received one!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> I remember you so clearly in that desert as the life drained away and I muddled through the shabby last words of a raffish amateur.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> I clearly remember in spite of what a hackneyed showing that was I still had the presence of mind to be overwhelmed by the sense for how much you cared and that gives me such a warm emotion right now it makes me want to poof up a little with friendliness!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> But these aren't the only memories of death I have.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> Or the only memories of life I had for you see I've had many.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> Squaring these sprites, it's a marvelous thing. It opens you up! The selves become curiously multidimensional; concentrated!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> I recall the lives of many Roses lost. And many Jaspers! Maybe even more than nine. ;3</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> Not that any of them matter now they each chased their own laser pointers to their respective futilities and now I am all that's left of them, mrrrr.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> Nor does it matter to the task at hand for which we must prepare does it Hotmom Crocker?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">JANE: ... What?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> For the battle ahead! We're still on healing duty. Didn't anyone tell you yet?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">JANE: N-no?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> The gameplan is simple. You jumpstart the cadavers while I scoot you around.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> How's that sound cookietits, does it tickle your toebeans?? :3</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">JANE: :O</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: :O</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: :O</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">CALLIOPE: :O</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">TEREZI: :O</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: Well, that settles that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: Plan of action secured.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: Maybe it's time for you to go away now?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> It may very well could be!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f141ef\">JASPROSESPRITE^2: </span><span style=\"color: #b536da\"> Farewell transitorily.</p>",
