The scenario is too pedestrian for you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: It would probably be a lot more effective putting yourself in danger and letting him be the hero.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: That's pretty much what he wants, right? To be a cheesy action film hero, with his twin berettas and silly shorts.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: A man of triumph on the silver screen. Standing tall on some fucking mountain. Conquering ruins, clutching a skull, and kissing a dude.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Pure Hollywood.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: See, this is why even if I did have a specific plan, I wouldn't go into details with you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You would just fuck it up. You're the biggest unknown quantity here.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Which is pretty weird, considering you're a virtual reflection of my own thought processes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: You're making a mistake not leveling with me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I am totally on your side, man.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: All of my machinations have been devised with your interests in mind.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: And anyway, it's too late for you to play \"damage control\" with me. My shit is in motion, and now we're beyond the pail.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Pretty sure it's pale.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Is it, now?</p>",
