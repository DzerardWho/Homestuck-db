Much like the one <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"/images/scraps/dontmoveorthebunnygetsit.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">held hostage</a> briefly by Malkovich's Cyrus \"The Virus\" while taunting hard-luck protagonist Cameron Poe. And strikingly similar to the one scooped up from the soot of a burning Vegas strip by Cage's Poe and offered to his daughter, a gesture symbolic of a tattered exterior surrounding a heart of gold. Poe wasn't much to look at. But he was a good man.\r<br/> <br/>But no, it is not merely LIKE that bunny. According to this NOTE OF AUTHENTICITY, it is the VERY SAME BUNNY.\r<br/> <br/>This is so awesome.\r<br/> <br/>Included is a note from your best bro Dave.</p>",
