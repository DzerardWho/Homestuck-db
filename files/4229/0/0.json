What is he even doing here? The question doesn't even occur to you. The island has been crawling with these things for as long as you can remember.\r<br/> <br/>You glance at the crudely rendered battle, direct your browser to the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HOMESTUCK BANDCAMP PAGE</a>, and browse for suitable battle music. Oh god, there are so many songs. Which one would be a good fit for this duel? Wait, yes, there's one. That's perfect. You hit play, close your eyes, and become lost in visions of gnashing crustacean carapace, smoking M9 casings, and Jake doing that thing where he flies through the air shooting two guns at once. Yes, so awesome. </p>",
