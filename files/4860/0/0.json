All these fuckers are totally famous, obviously.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh sure obviously.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: We've talked about the guy I'm genetically derived from a lot actually.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Like, you know, every time I've ever talked about my bro?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Gadzooks of course!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: With all your future mindfuckery you made me completely forget about your vaunted hollywood sibling.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I shoulda asked where he fit into the picture if you were raised alone. I can be dumb as a bag of penny candy sometimes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Sometimes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Other times you're on point, like a bag of the nickel shit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Whoa now those are the sweets kept in reserve for millionaires. Such flattery!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Ok, what we're sayin' stopped meaning anything, so I'll continue.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Right. So then he was never actually your bro?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: No, that's just kind of how I view him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Lalonde took a more maternal view of her ancestor.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: The lady who wrote all the dreary wizard books i presume?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Yeah, the CotL series. Ever read it?</p>",
