The stardust did nothing! Probably because it is just glittery powder with no magical properties whatsoever and is basically bullshit. Because in case it wasn't clear, magic isn't real, and neither are miracles.\r<br/> <br/><span style=\"font-style: italic\">OR</span> <br/> <br/>It could just be that Pupa has failed to have a happy thought! \r<br/> <br/>Your duty is clear. You will have to MAKE him have happy thoughts.</p>",
