AND HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF GNOMES UNDER MY COMMAND.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YELLOW HAT. BLUE HAT. RED HAT. AND NOW PURPLE HAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Congratulations.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THE PLANETS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO CONQUER.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I ALMOST DID NOT MANAGE TO DESTROY THE PURPLE PLANET. WITHIN THE ALLOTTED TIME.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">UNFORTUNATELY. THE QUALITY OF THE UNLOCKED GNOMES HAS NOT INCREASED TO MATCH THE ESCALATING DIFFICULTY OF MY QUEST.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">IT SEEMS TO BE JUST THE OPPOSITE. THESE GNOMES ARE SHIT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">What's wrong with the new gnomes?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">OK. RED HAT? HE HAS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">*NO FUCKING POWERS AT ALL.*</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">UNLESS HIS POWER IS TO FOLLOW ME AROUND CONSTANTLY.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yes. That's basically what he does.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">PURPLE HAT IS EVEN WORSE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">IS HIS POWER TO DANCE AROUND ALL THE TIME. WHILE SINGING RIDDLES TO ME?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">AWFUL.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">PURPLE HAT'S BEHAVIOR IS SO INFURIATING. I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO MURDER HIM SEVERAL TIMES.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">BUT TO NO AVAIL.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You can't kill purple hat. He's too lucky!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">That's also his power. Being really lucky.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT GOOD DOES THAT DO ME???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I don't know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Get him to solve puzzles for you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Use him as a human shield sometimes?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I mean a gnome shield.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">OH YEAH. THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD IDEA.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You shouldn't be whining about how lame your minions are.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">As you accumulate more, your job is obviously to combine their talents in creative ways to overcome the increasingly difficult challenges on your quest.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Synergize your time gnomes. Make them more than the sum of their pointy hats.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THAT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THEY ARE ALL IDIOTS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Nobody said it would be easy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">FINE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I HAVE NO MORE QUESTIONS FOR NOW.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Hey.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Did you kill that cute turtle?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">But I can see your past trail.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You're standing there holding a gun, and pointing it at the turtle.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">OK. THEN YES.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I KILLED THE TURTLE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Boooooooooo.</p>",
