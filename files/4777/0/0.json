In the new instance, we would lead completely different lives with no memory of what happened.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: So we did, and created A2. Your instance, your world, and your game in which we were all inexplica8ly created in the first place.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: As I said, this time around the world was........ interesting.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">GC: TH4T'S WH3N TROLLS B3C4M3 T3RR1BL3?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Not all of you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Some had lessons from the old world to teach others. 8ut few ever heard them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">GC: SO 1N YOUR T1M3, 3V3RYON3 W4S 4S N1C3 4S YOU?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Not exactly. 8ut life was pretty mild and uneventful.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I'm not even sure if I was especially nice, 8y our standards.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Mostly kind of 8oring.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: No8ody from my party liked me a whole lot.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I think I talked too much, and had a ha8it of 8ringing conversations 8ack around to myself.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Not that it matters anymore, 8ut it was not the 8est way to make friends.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">GC: H3H3H3H3.

Unfortunately it came along with our people's enslavement and near extinction.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Not that I really got to live as her, exactly. 8ut at least I got a chance to follow her life. And it was a very long life.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8eing here for ages has its 8enefits.</p>",
