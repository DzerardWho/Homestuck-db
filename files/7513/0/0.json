She was always pretty put off by it to be honest.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: heheh. poor jane.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i'll have to apologize to her for freaking her out from beyond the grave.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: what was her life like otherwise?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: Pretty typical id say.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: She always characterized it as boring.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: But i never agreed really she got to live on the main land with access to all kinds of things i didnt have.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: Plus she lived with a cool and manly father who cared about her a lot and seemed like a standup gent.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: oh, she lived with her dad too?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: do you know anything about him?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: Not much other than what i just said and a few things she told me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: I think he was stern and fatherly and dressed well if memory serves he was a private detective at one point.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: a private detective???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: wow.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: it sounds like he must have been a completely different kind of dad from the one i had.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: all these differences are so interesting... some are subtle, but some are drastic, like this one apparently is.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: it would be neat to meet him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i mean, not that it would be much of a substitute for getting to see my dad again, since they're totally different people, but...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: you know what i mean.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: do you know what happened to him?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: Im not sure i kinda lost track of him for a while...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: I think he might be in jail?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: jail??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: Yeah on derse.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: I THINK. I could be wrong though.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i'll make a mental note to check on him some time soon.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i bet jane would want to too, when she wakes up. i'll ask her about it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: Good idea!</p>",
