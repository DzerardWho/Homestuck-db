The result is a pair of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Kernels</span>, one dark, one light, each carrying the information they were prototyped with before the hatch!</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: One goes down, to a kingdom entrenched in darkness. The other, up, to a kingdom basking in light! Each comes to rest in an <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Orb</span> atop a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Spire</span>, of which there are three others in kind. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">The Four Spires</span> are situated above a throne, and these two thrones preside over the two respective <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Sovereign Powers</span>!</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: And once the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Kernels</span> are situated, that is when the game is afoot. The true war begins, light versus dark, good versus evil.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: This is a war that the forces of light are always destined to lose, without exception!</p>",
