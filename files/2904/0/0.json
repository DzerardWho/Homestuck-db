    "pesterlog": "-- tentacleTherapist <span style=\"color: #b536da\">[TT]</span> began pestering ectoBiologist <span style=\"color: #0715cd\">[EB]</span> --\n\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: rose, i have a question, and i am in a hurry!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: so hurry up and answer!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Did you know your planet was on fire?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: oh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: it is?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Yes. It makes a good light for reading, actually.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: ok, haha, that's a confusing thing you said, but that topic will have to wait!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: jade is minutes away from entering, and i need to decide what to do with this kernel sprite.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i really don't want to mess up and do something stupid.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i was thinking about not prototyping at all, to not give the monsters any new powers.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: what do you think, rose?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i thought i'd ask since you seem to know all the mysteries.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Yes, I do seem to be shadowed by each mystery and its somber cortege of riddles, don't I?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: that is exactly what i was going to say.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: First of all, I should preface this conversation by saying I know exactly what you and Jade are going to do.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: um...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: ok?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: The more of our future I've been allowed to see, the more I'm presented with a challenge I'm not very comfortable with.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: The trolls have tipped us off about what's to come without any regard for the consequences, as appears to be their nature.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: But maybe that's why it's worked for them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Maybe their indiscretion mingles with the cosmic noise that is the fabric of temporal uncertainty.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: bluhhhhhh...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: rose, tick tick tick!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Sorry, John.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I'm just nervous about it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: About whether telling you what you definitely will or won't do will alter a predetermined outcome.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: The result would be a splintered timeline, and we would all be sentenced to eventual oblivion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I'm presently optimistic this has not happened yet, and this is still the alpha timeline. I'd like to keep it that way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: oh, wow.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: you mean like when i died in another dimension, because terezi hornswoggled me?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Yes, sort of.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It isn't much fun, John.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: what's not?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Living for months in an offshoot reality, waiting for the curtain to drop.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: oh, ok, i see.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: well, uh...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: is there anything you can tell me?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Hmm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I guess I can permit myself to tell you this, somewhat definitively.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: what?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Failing to prototype the kernel is the absolute worst thing that you could possibly do.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Like, ever.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: oh no!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: We would come into possession of all the disasters.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Exhaustive possession. Monopolization, in fact.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: then i guess i will not do that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: why is it so bad?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Because the battlefield will not be able to heal, and then transform.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It will not reach the stage which allows it to become ready to receive our universe.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: but...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i thought you said it wasn't going to be able to make a universe anyway?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: wasn't it barren or something?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: so why is it important?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Because if it does not reach this stage, we will not be able to recover the treasure hidden in its core.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Which is to say,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: You will not be able to recover it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: When you go to sleep again.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: OHHHHHH.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: why didn't you say so, of course the answer is treasure.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Yes. This is the treasure that will give us hope.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: But only if it comes into being in the first place.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: what is the treasure exactly?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: John, what is that sound?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: what sound?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It seems to be a ticking noise.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: aaaahh!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: yeah, i've got to go. we can chat about treasure later.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: anyway, i will sort out this prototyping silliness myself.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: thanks rose!</p>\n\n-- ectoBiologist <span style=\"color: #0715cd\">[EB]</span> ceased pestering tentacleTherapist <span style=\"color: #b536da\">[TT]</span> --</p>",
