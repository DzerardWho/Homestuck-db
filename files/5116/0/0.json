It is the most beautiful thing you have ever seen in your life. How your brother would love to get his grubby claws on it. And how you would love to get yours on his, for that matter.\r<br/> <br/>Suddenly it becomes painfully clear that we aren't going to get a look at this thing. At least not for a while. How typical.\r<br/> <br/>Why don't we stop wasting everyone's time, shut the lid on this lousy MacGuffin, and get on with it.</p>",
