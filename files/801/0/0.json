It is peaceful and quiet as usual. A rather imposing VOLCANO looms over your house, which has been inactive for centuries. \r<br/> <br/>Though dormant on the surface, the volcanic activity deep underground provides your house with a source of GEOTHERMAL POWER. You are not sure why your grandfather decided to draw from this source of energy when he had the UNLIMITED POWER OF THE ATOM at his disposal. But it has been this way for as long as you can remember. \r<br/> <br/>You have chalked it up to your family's longstanding propensity for eclectic fursuits wait you mean pursuits.</p>",
