It doesn't look like it's as much fun as the original ride, but to be fair it's probably a lot safer.\r<br/> <br/>Double-punching cards creates patterns with more holes, rather than less holes by overlapping cards. This strikes you as a viable method for combining more than two items without whittling down to too few holes, or too many! Just mix up the overlaps and double-punches, and the sky's the limit.</p>",
