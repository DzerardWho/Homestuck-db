Incarnation</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: He Is The Universe That You Are Trying To Create</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: yes i got that!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Sorry</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Thought It Was Obvious But Then Wasnt Sure</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: you mean he is LITERALLY a universe?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Yes Literally</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: That Statement Was As Literal As You Can Possibly Make Words Be</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Know Your Species Is Frequently Insincere For A Variety Of Reasons</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: but your species is too!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: especially karkat, he is incredibly sarcastic</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Thats True But When We Do It Its Usually Just Because We Are Trying To Be Jerks</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Rather Than By Way Of A Mild Manner Perpetually Dispatching Little Puzzles Of Rhetoric Without Apparent Purpose</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: but i dont do that!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i try to say what i mean as much as i can</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Yeah I Think Ive Been Discerning That</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Its A Nice Change Of Pace</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: from what?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Oh Its Not Important</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: haha, you mean from rose?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Well</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Not That It Wasnt An Enjoyable Exercise In Xenocultural Inculcation</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: yeah, rose and dave are like that all the time!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: they inculcate that stuff like crazy</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: so you have been talking to her a lot i guess?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Sort Of</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: are you best friends now??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Guess As Mutually Friendly As The Time Has Permitted Two People To Be</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Wont Be Speaking To Her Anymore Though</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: why?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: oh yeah, because you said she is blacked out?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: what the heck does that mean!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: It Just Means In A Few Moments From Your Perspective I Wont Be Able To See Her Through My Viewport Or Talk To Her</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Dont Know Why Exactly But Its Not That Hard To Guess</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: She Has Been Relying On The Powers And Counsel Of Dark Gods And Other Sources Of Ambiguous Intent</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: And She Has Consequently Devised A Plan Which Sounds Very Dangerous To Me</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: yeah, i didnt like the sound of her plan either!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: You Are More Sensible</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Its Probably The Influence Skaia Has Had On You</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Having Spent Much Of Your Life Awake On Prospit</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Like Me</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: you did???????</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: If Were Alike In Some Ways Maybe Its Because Of This</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: yeah! :D</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Woke Up A Long Time Ago</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Had Trouble Sleeping When I Was Young</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: The Sunlight Was Unnaturally Invigorating To Me I Guess</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: My Lusus Could Do Nothing To Help</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: And When I Was Supposed To Be In My Cocoon I Would Often Wander Out To The Desert</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Where One Day I Was Visited By A Stranger Who Dressed And Spoke In White</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: He Put Me To Sleep And I Awoke On Prospit</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Where I Have Dreamed Ever Since</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: He Said He Was My Guardian</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: And Though He Visited Rarely I Did Regard Him As That</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Then Later He Stopped Coming</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: In Time I Began To Believe He Was A Figment Of My Mind</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Like An Imaginary Friend To Give Me Reassurance When I Needed It</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: But Then While Playing Our Game I Learned He Was Real</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: He Had Spoken To Others From Our Party</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: And Had Been Manipulating Us All To Advance His Schemes</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: It Was Saddening To Learn My Fortuitous Awakening Had Been The Product Of A Nefarious Ploy</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Youre Lucky That Your Awakening Probably Had No Such Entanglements</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: jeez, i hope not...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: But I Guess Its Only A Minor Contamination Of Something Otherwise Great</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Was Allowed To See What Skaia Would Show Me</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: And To Prepare For Dangers Ahead And Try To Protect People</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: me too!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: wow kanaya i did not realize how much we had in common</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Youre Right We Do</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Feel A Bit Silly That It Took Me So Long To Engage With The One Corresponding Closely With My Role</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: It Must Be A Certain Madness Im Afflicted By</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: To Orbit Those More Reckless And Dangerous Than I And More Daring For It</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Guess I Want To Help Them But They Never Can Be Helped It Seems</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: well, it sounds like helping people is something that is in your nature</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i can understand that</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: are you saying rose is reckless and dangerous?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Yes Definitely</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: We Have Our Share Of Dangerous Players Who Seem To Do Nothing But Cause Problems</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Believe She Is Yours</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: And If Her Insane Plan Wasnt Alarming Enough</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: She Has Been Communicating With The Stranger I Mentioned</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: And Unsurprisingly She Has Not Been Forthright About The Nature Of Their Conversations</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: you mean your guardian?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Yes</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: And Hes Not Merely A Guardian</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Im Very Sure He Is A First Guardian</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Like Your Lusus Was</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: uh oh...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: im not sure why, but the sound of that makes me really nervous</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Feel The Same Way About It</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: The Involvement Of Any Such Entity Strikes Me As Quite Inauspicious</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Even When Seemingly Benign</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: she didnt mention anything about this when we talked</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: but then she seemed preoccupied</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: She Was</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Youll Have A Chance To Determine More Soon</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: After Which Hopefully You Can Tell Me</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: yeah, i will!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: In The Meantime I Will Go</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Would Like To Return To The Core To Situate This Orb</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: It Seems You Have Your Own Orb To Care For Now</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: lol yeah i guess so!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: ok, you can go do that, and i guess i will check on rose, but...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: theres still so much i want to know!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i want to know more about stoking the forge and breeding the frogs, and about your time on prospit and all that!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Okay I Will Definitely Help You As Much As I Can</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: The Young Prospit Wakers Ought To Stick Together</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: yes! &lt;3</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Ill Message You Again In Your Future</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: And You May Reply If You Have Cause To</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: if i have cause to?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: oh!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: that reminds me, i was thinking of implementing a system to keep some of these confusing conversations simple and linear</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Does It By Any Chance Have To Do With Passwords</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: yeah! i guess someone told you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Yes You</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: You Delivered News Of The System By Demanding A Password From Me</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: aaaaa you see??????</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: you nearly just gave me the idea for the plan in the first place paradoxically from my own future self!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i just find that kind of thing annoying for some reason, it doesnt feel right...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i would rather ideas came from the place they actually came from</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Thats A Reasonable Attitude</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: ok lets put the system in play starting now!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i will give you a password, and you give it to me in the future when you want to pick up this conversation again</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Okay</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: the password is...............</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: CROOOOOOOOOOOAK</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: it must be in all caps, and must contain precisely ten Os!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Ten</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Im Counting Eleven</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: whoops!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: eleven then :p</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: The Password System Is Already Paying Overwhelming Dividends Of Ease And Rationality</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: kanaya :o</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: that sounded</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: just a weeeeeee bit</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: sarcastic ;D</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Oh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Wow Yeah</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Hope Im Not Falling Prey To A Crisis Of Sincerity</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: you are just becoming multicultural, thats all</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i think i am learning to be more multicultural through karkat as well</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: it mostly involves saying fuck a lot</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Oh No</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: heheheheh, its ok, hes really not so bad</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Yeah I Know</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: ok! go hatch that orb!</p>\n<p
