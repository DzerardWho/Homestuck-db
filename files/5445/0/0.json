The idea of storing an object, and then... freely being able to retrieve it any time? Without having to barter with a truculent sibling over a series of inconvenient naps? It's almost too much liberation to fathom. You truly are a free, adult man, and you are so, so proud of yourself.\r<br/> <br/>You love having a dead sister. Having a dead sister is an experience you would highly recommend to everybody.</p>",
