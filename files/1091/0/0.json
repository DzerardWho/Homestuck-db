AW SNAP!!!\r<br/> <br/>but yeah, i got you this because i think you're really creative and you could make something nice with it if you put your mind to it. and it might help you take your mind off a lot of all this serious business you're always absorbed in. you know, all this weirdo pseudo-gothy stuff or whatever. frankly it's kind of depressing. \r<br/> <br/>anyway you're the best rose! have a rad 13th! (i will catch up with you guys soon. god you're all so old.)\r<br/> <br/>~ghostyTrickster\r<br/>(john)</span></p>",
