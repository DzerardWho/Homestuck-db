You can't imagine how a video game could save someone's life, and in any case, you're quite sure no one you know is in any danger.\r<br/> <br/>Anyway, these are your copies of the beta you received in the mail recently. You've labeled them with your name in BOLD RED PRINT to distinguish them from your BRO's copies, who labeled his in kind. Neither of you really gives a shit about this game or has any intention of playing it, but you'll be damned if you'll let that get in the way of your campaign of one-upmanship. </p>",
