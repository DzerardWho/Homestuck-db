In your own cool, sort of roundabout way of course. Good thing you looked at that box he sent you, or you might have forgotten.\r<br/> <br/>You also might as well ask him about that beta. The kid's been harping about it for weeks. It would be cool if it came on his birthday. He'd be one happy camper.</p>",
