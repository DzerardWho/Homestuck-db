similarities, we are very different from trolls and hUmans.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: we are not a social race. we generally will not ever encoUnter another of oUr kind, Unless it is time to mate.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: and when that time comes, oUr coUrtship is nothing like it is for hUmans.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: it is highly confrontational and violent.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: sounds so lonely</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">TG: plus w/ hecks of tricky sex</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: it is lonely.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: bUt that is in oUr natUre, to be alone. jUst as it is to find attraction throUgh contempt.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: now that i think aboUt it, i shoUld have

style=\"color: #929292\">UU: i believed he and i coUld play together, even Under oUr UniqUe biological circUmstances.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: i was so daft, i thoUght skaia had actUally made an exception for Us.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: and that we coUld overcome oUr conflicts, work together, and fUlfill the game's minimUm reqUirement of two players. one of space and the other of time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: bUt i was always fooling myself.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: it is now clear only one of Us will sUrvive.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: my skaian visions have misled me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: or i have blinded myself to their trUe meaning.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: this was always meant to be a

style=\"color: #929292\">UU: it is a shame that i won't be able to play, i gUess for selfish reasons.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: i was so looking forward to it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: i really thoUght i was going to be someone special.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #929292\">UU: that i coUld Use my abilities do something no one had ever done.</p>\n<p style=\"color:
