The convers8tion we are having right now 8ears a striking resem8lance to a8solute nonsense.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: I recall once your dream self appeared out of thin air, just as you have done now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: And I did you the favor of helping you on your way. Don't you remem8er?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: There's no need to thank me. I'm quite 8enevolent 8y nature. I prefer to do the right thing, even in situations where I'm not likely to receive credit for my good deeds.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Holy shit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Can you stop saying stuff?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: No need to 8e so rude. I'm just curious.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: As an ancient and learned scholar, I'm versed in a wide range of unusual phenomena. However I must say I am flummoxed 8y the nature of your 8eing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: What exactly <span style=\"font-style: italic\">are</span> you?</p>",
