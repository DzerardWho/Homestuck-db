You can see where the dramatic schism between our species and hers begins, and also why she had a reputation for being quite insane.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: But she also happens to have this one humongous sea monster lusus that is like her own personal bodyguard, and kind of a secret weapon.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: But it turns out the thing is kind of an enigma. Sort of a double edged eldritch horror. As much in her service as it is calling the shots, in some unfathomable way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Every time she tried to resurrect her race, it would slaughter them all psychically. As if it was keeping her ambition in check.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Or so the story goes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Wait... these beasts tend to the young??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I can tell you from first hand experience that monsters are totally rotten at taking care of kids!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: They do a bangup job of making em scared though. :(</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Exactly.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: The plan was beyond shitty.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: So does that mean you and rox were raised by these things?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Nope.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It was a very short lived experiment centuries ago.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Humans just don't have the same evolutionary symbiosis with those things that her race had.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It turns out a bunch of fuckin' alien monsters have no interest whatsoever in taking care of human babies.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: They mostly just wound up eating them, or at best, just abandoning them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Later she instated a lusidroid system to serve the same function, as she began phasing in more robotic solutions in favor of all this ill conceived biotech nonsense that always did nothing but backfire.</p>",
