style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: If there's one thing you and your friends regularly remind us, it's that time is not on our side.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Know</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: But I Thought Our Methods Earlier Were Effective</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: In Illuminating The Underpinnings Of The Game</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: You Ask Some Questions</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: And I Answer</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: If I Can</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Yes, that has been effective.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: But you don't know everything, do you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: No</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: My current strategy is comprehensive.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Your notes have been helpful, but the facts you've supplied are being cross-referenced with understandings I already have, and data gathered by the sort of means presently on display.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I still have more questions for you, which I will ask in time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Okay</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: But These Means Presently On Display</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Are Making Me A Little Nervous</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Think Its Kind Of A Reckless Use Of</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Of what?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: These Forces</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Dark magic, you mean?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Yes</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Well</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Influence By The Gods From The Furthest Ring</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: The Communion You Seem To Have Developed With Them I Find Kind Of Troubling</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I don't think they are as nefarious as you might imagine.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Many of them seem to be intent on helping us.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: How Exactly Do You Know That</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: From their whispers in my dreams.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: How Much Time Have You Really Spent Sleeping</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Since You Began Playing</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Not much.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: But quite a lot in a failed timeline.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: And now and then, memories surface from that alternate reality.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Vague memories, but unmistakable in familiarity, like spontaneously remembering a dream from years ago by some inexplicable catalyst.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: In that reality, they spoke to me in my sleep and told me much of what I needed to know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Including what to do to reset our timeline and create the present reality.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: That Makes Me No Less Nervous</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Our Understanding Is That Influence From Doomed Timelines</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Though Seemingly Necessary To Advance In The Alpha Reality</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Is Generally Inauspicious</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Travelers From Such Branches Are Marked For Death</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: And Though It Was Only An Insubstantial Part Of You Which Traveled</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Just Memories I Suppose</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Its Still Troubling</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I have assurances I'm on the right track.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Surely you must have spoken to the gods by now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: What did they tell you to make you so suspicious?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Actually</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Havent</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Have Never Visited Derse Or Traveled Beyond The Veil</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Prospits Moon Was My Home</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: For Most Of My Dreaming Life</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It was?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Yes</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: This surprises me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Why</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: ...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Good question.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Skaia Was Always The Foil For My Curiosity</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: But It Only Showed Me What I Needed To See</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: It Very Much Had The Presence Of Something Sentient</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: And</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Benevolent</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: But Silent</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Not Something To Converse With Or Be Instructed By</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Or Anything With An Agenda Beyond Which It Knows To Be Manifest Already</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Like A Very Clear Mirror</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: That Has Everything There Is To See Inside It</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: But Only Some Things Are Visible At Any Given Moment</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Always Trusted It</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: And I Dont Trust Gods That Would Eschew Its Light</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: You didn't actually answer my question.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: When was it exactly that you read my walkthrough?</p>",
