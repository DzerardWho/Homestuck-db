All this uncertainty is wearing thinner than the only pair of pants in an immortal's wardrobe.\r<br/> <br/>I've never much enjoyed navigating the vortices of alternative possibility. The path which alone has my absolute mastery is the alpha timeline, a continuum I define as that which boasts exclusive rights both to my birth and to my death, two circumstantially simultaneous events. Any divergence from this path to my knowing will taper into blackness like rotting roots. But if I was a Seer, such offshoots would be fully within my domain. And if I was a Seer of Mind in particular, synaptic causality would be my specialty. \r<br/> <br/>A Seer of Mind would have given you a more reliable account, perhaps. But then, she would do many things I wouldn't.</p>",
