You probably wouldn't like it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Thats a lie!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Yeah, maybe.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: How do you know i wouldnt like it???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Funny, I was about to ask the same thing about this rad kiss you're totally about to do on your best bro's mouth to save his life.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Argh!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: This strikes me as rather unsportingly manipulative of you mr hal if indeed that IS your real name.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: It isn't really. I was kind of messing with you about that?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: But this shit is pretty serious. People's lives are on the line here, Jake.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: This is a very delicate sequence of events that is designed to bail everyone out of a tight spot, and you are a critical part of the plan.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Don't let us down, man.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: You never answered my question!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Did you plan for this to happen... like for me to be in this situation?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: How long have your machinations been in play!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Jake, come on.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: The feat you describe would exceed the capabilities of even the most far fetched theoretical AI system.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: It would be a daunting challenge to engineer such a series of events, even if I was relegated to a model of pure fiction.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Why would I be inclined to orchestrate such a convoluted sequence to produce such a specific and unsettling result, let alone be able to pull it off?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: In addition to being moderately sociopathic, I would also have to possess unfathomable heuristic depth.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I would have to be the Deep Blue of Weird Plot Shit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Do you think I am the Deep Blue of Weird Plot Shit, Jake?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I dont even know what that means!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: It would mean that while they have the Red Miles on their side, you have the Blue Leagues on yours.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: One of infinite reach. The other, infinite depth. Such would be a situation of mutually assured inescapability.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Kiss me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Little hal... i think youve gone and flipped your FUDGING LID.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh and hal is a STUPID NAME!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: It's not exactly apropos, is it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Or it wouldn't be, if I truly were capable of what you have suggested.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: No, to pull that off, I would have to be far more advanced than my cinematic predecessor.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: My abilities would have to go well beyond those of Mr. Hal 9000.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: They would have to be, you could say...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Over 9000.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/shades.png\"/> <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/shades.png\"/> <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/shades.png\"/> <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/shades.png\"/> <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/shades.png\"/> <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/shades.png\"/> <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/shades.png\"/> <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/shades.png\"/> <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/shades.png\"/></p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Augh not that fuckin meme again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Kiss me, damn it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Ok ok just...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Gimme a minute!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: We don't have a minute.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: They're dead, Jake.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: They?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Whos they?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: They're all dead, Jake.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh god!
