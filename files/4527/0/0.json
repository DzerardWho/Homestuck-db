Had to go and get all tangled up with your brother's crazy, complicated life.\r<br/> <br/>As for the other one...\r<br/> <br/>You are a studious popculture scholar of all eras.

No, seriously.\r<br/> <br/>...\r<br/> <br/>What?\r<br/> <br/>......\r<br/> <br/>OK FINE, YOU LOVE THIS ONE PARTICULAR LITTLE RAINBOW HORSE UNIRONICALLY, IS THAT SUCH A CRIME. \r<br/> <br/>She is so spunky. &lt;3</p>",
