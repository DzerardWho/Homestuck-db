That's her.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I guess she got 8oth of us then. Un8elieva8le.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: she tricked you too?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Well, not tricked, so much as made a pointless coin flip and sta88ed me in the 8ack.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: wow. that's pretty cold blooded!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Oh, sure. She was easily the most underhanded and villainous mem8er of our group.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ut I did let my guard down. And even when she sta88ed me, I sure didn't think I was going to die.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: why not?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: It turns out immortality isn't all it's cracked up to 8e. Let's leave it at that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: hmm...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: so i guess you never got around to giving me immortality like you said? or killing me, for that matter.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: sounds like the blind troll beat you to it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: No, I did! 8ut........</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Ugh, this will 8e hard to explain to you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: explain what?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Haha. I guess in her own sick way, she actually set us up on this d8 together.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: May8e I should thank her whenever she falls asleep? Or dies, god for8id.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: so...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: now it is a date?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I don't know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I said it wouldn't 8e unless you remem8ered. And now you remem8er.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ut you still don't remem8er me, do you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: nope.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yeah, thought so.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: This version of you died 8efore I started messing with you. Not that I expect you to understand what that means.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: no, i get that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: if i had decided not to take the shortcut, i would have lived. and then you would have talked to me a lot?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yes, that's right.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I guess I should have learned to give you more credit 8y now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: well, i might not have figured that out, if not for...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: some things that just happened.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I still can't 8elieve I'm meeting a version of you that doesn't remem8er a thing a8out me. None of my gr8 exploits, or any of the ways I helped you. Only that one stupid time I taunted you!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: It's a vaguely frustr8ing feeling.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: sorry... not sure what to tell you!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: So you remem8er literally nothing I told you a8out myself? Not even the, uh........</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Compromising stuff?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: well, you did just show me around your planet. which was really cool!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: ... there's compromising stuff?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Your species would think so. 8ut I guess it doesn't matter anymore.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i guess not.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: but who says we can't get to know each other again?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: You wouldn't find that 8oring?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: no way! not if you wouldn't.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: you said the name of the blind troll who killed us, but you have not told me yours yet.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I haven't?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: no.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: ........</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: It's Vriska.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: nice to meet you, vriska.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i am john! even though you know that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: so now what do we do? aside from be dead for probably ever.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Man, I don't know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: May8e,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: You could tell me a8out how you died?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: What were the \"things that just happened\" you were talking a8out?</p>",
