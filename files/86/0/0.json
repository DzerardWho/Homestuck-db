It seems your DAD has been doing so much baking, the glass has steamed up.\r<br/> <br/>God he is so weird.\r<br/> <br/>But you can see what's on the table just beside the window. It looks like the mail is there! Included among it is a RED PACKAGE, some BILLS, your DAD'S PDA, and an envelope that appears to be suspiciously labeled with the SBURB LOGO. Could it be???\r<br/> <br/>Unfortunately, the window is locked.</p>",
