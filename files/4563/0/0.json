Think you can handle that, dude?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I'm all about being able to handle that, you don't even know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I will perform an acrobatic pirouette on to the handle, wherein the handle literally represents my ability to handle that thing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Ok, got it. You and the handle are tight.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: We don't need a whole thing about this.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Once I stick the landing on the handle like a champ, I am going to get down on one knee, pull out a ring, and propose to it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: The handle I mean.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Implying we will be married.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: :B</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Ok, long story short, you and the handle fuck gratuitously. Nuff said.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Try not to say I never gave you any responsibilities, or never took you seriously as a viable conscious being with free will.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Also, please try not to make me regret this.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: You have nothing to worry about. Go talk to the alien.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">timaeusTestified [TT]</span> ceased pestering <span style=\"color: #00d5f2\">gutsyGumshoe [GG]</p>",
