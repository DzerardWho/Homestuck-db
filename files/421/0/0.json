A realm that is a ring of pure void, dividing light and darkness. It turns in the thick of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">The Incipisphere</span>, a place untouched by the flow of time in your universe.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: you mean because we are inside a computer, or in the game software or something?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: A computer? Why, what is that, dear? Some new fangled contraption, like the horseless auto-boxcar?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: well, uh, it's like this machine that, uh...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: Hoo hoo hoo! Of course I know what a computer is, John! I was just pulling your leg! Hoo hoo hoo!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: oh, ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: No, John. You are not inside a computer or software or anything like that! Try not to be so linear, dear. The software that brought you here was merely a mechanism that served as a gateway! Its routines in a way served to invoke this realm's instance, yet it stands independently of any physical machine, and somewhat paradoxically, always has!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i'm not sure i get it, but alright.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: so what do i actually need to be doing here?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: I think it would be best if we started with the big picture!</p>",
