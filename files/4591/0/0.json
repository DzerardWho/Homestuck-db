Its so great to have a friend as good as you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: That is what I am good for, it seems!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: If we hadnt cleared the air just now i probably never would have had the gumption to talk about it with you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Its so cool how you were honest with me about how you felt. I think honesty is always the best policy. I cant believe how much i was overcomplicating all this in my head.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Haha the situation is really pretty funny when you think about it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Yeaaaaaaaah..........</p>",
