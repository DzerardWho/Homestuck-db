It seemed like you were doing something so important at the time. Finally everything made sense. This was why you were here.\r<br/> <br/>But what was the point? You are all clearly going to die the most pointless deaths possible. Everything you believed about your destiny was meaningless. You wish you never pushed those buttons and hatched your team out of all this goddamn slime. You are no ectobiologist. If only there was some other title more befitting of the true discipline you practice, and the death sentence given to whatever you do the disservice of creating. You can't think of one though.\r<br/> <br/>And what about the OTHER twelve wigglers you spawned? Who were they? Probably further proof this was all meaningless and random. Could it be that they were the true heroes meant to be sent back to play this game, while your team was the superfluous crop? Could a mistake have been made during the reckoning? \r<br/> <br/>Or just maybe, she was right about them all along. Not that it makes any difference now.\r<br/> <br/>Something is stirring behind you. Something unconscious and toothless.</p>",
