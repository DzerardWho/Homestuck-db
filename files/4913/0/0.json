Well, maybe not all 89 times. For the first 88 you felt pretty good. But by the 89th face bashing, you were definitely starting to feel pretty sorry.\r<br/> <br/>And by sorry, you guess you mean bored.\r<br/> <br/>Anyway, you mutter something under your breath that could EASILY sound like an apology to someone who wasn't listening very well.</p>",
