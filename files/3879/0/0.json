In fact, if you were on my couch that would have been my next question, as a licensed professional.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: \"Mr. Strider, have you considered that what you actually dread is to have your urban rhythms exposed for what they truly are, which is, clinically speaking, just shy of 'da bomb'?\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: and then we crack up laughing cause we both know theyre fresher than your moms change of drawers and tighter than when shes wearin them</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Listening to you conjure imagery of my mother in her underpants is definitely keeping us buoyed high above this swirling Freudian hellhole.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Well done.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: please its not like shes my mom i can visualize her choice ass all i want without it gettin much more than moderately uncomfortable for everyone involved</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: What if you're wrong?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: about what</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Her not being your mother.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: uh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Don't worry, you're probably safe. Luckily I can think of no literary or historical precedent for that sort of folly whatsoever.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: this isnt the first time youve insinuated were related what is up with that</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Isn't it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: no</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: i mean</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: im not sure</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: i feel like youve brought it up before which is kind of weird but now i dont know</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: i think im getting this weird deja vu thing where i was sure we talked about this</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: forget it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Why don't you tell me more about your dream?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: ok</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: so i kept dying and kept being crows and stuff</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: and then i started to notice something coming from the sky</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: it was this faint eerie singing and i look up and theres nothing there just darkness</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: That's interesting.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I've read about this.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: what did you read</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Certain texts say singing from the unknowable void carries a message.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: That its recipient has been selected for a mission of supreme cosmic importance, that will result in your death and that of billions more.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: But one that is essential to the perpetuation of existence itself.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: what the fuck sort of crackpot psychology text would say something like that</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It's not from a psychology text.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: so then youre consulting astrology books now</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Not astrology.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: More like,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Zoology.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: oh my fucking god will you put that away</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Keep describing the dream, though.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: If the rest of it is incompatible with prognoses of the zoologically dubious, I will withdraw my insinuation.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: theres not even much more to it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: i looked up into the sky</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: didnt see anyone singing</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: but even though the sky was black i could see the sun</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: it was bright as hell even through my shades</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: so i flapped my wings and flew up away to it like a fucking piece of garbage</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: and thats it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: This doesn't strike you as an impulse of self destruction?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: no</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: not in the sense that it was a dark sacrificial zoology mission</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: it was more like somewhere to go besides watching myself die a lot from the vantage of a feathery murder of dumb shitty birds</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: So, if hypothetically you were to accept such a mission, or even insist upon one, it wouldn't be in the spirit of genuine sacrifice, but of escape?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: what the fuck are you talking about</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: ok somethings wrong</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: this whole conversation is falling apart this isnt how it originally went at all</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Aw. We were making good progress, too.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Why did you have to go and remember?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: this happened months ago</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: does this mean im dead</p>",
