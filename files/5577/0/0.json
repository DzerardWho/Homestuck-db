OOF. that onell leave a mark. beatrix regained her calm. \"so whos this guy thats supposed to save him?\" she asked. \"you say hes the villain?\"\n\n\"here he comes now.\"\n\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/wizardyherberttext2.png\"/>\n\nbeatrix squinted at the serpenook boy. she didnt know why she couldnt see it coming. \"grant??\"\n\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/wizardyherberttext3.png\"/>\n\n\"a favor?\" russet said. but he was barely listening. the resemblance to his real life friend was uncanny. he was sure it was him. but here in this dumb prison he was no more than a soulless mannequin dreamt up to recite insipid horseshit.\n\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/wizardyherberttext4.png\"/>\n\nactually he said it like a zombie. \"never. ill never betray my friends.\"\n\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/wizardyherberttext5.png\"/>\n\n\"russet\" he whispered.\n\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/wizardyherberttext6.png\"/>\n\nthe guy paused to remove his glasses and polished them on his sash. it came off as a seriously dramatic gesture, just as intended and also as explicitly stated in the text.\n\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/wizardyherberttext7.png\"/>\n</span> </p>",
