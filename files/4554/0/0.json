If you were, you could have said something to Jane instead.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Almost like you enjoy sitting back and watching what happens when shit goes wrong.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Has it occurred to you that maybe I have diabolical interwoven plans just like you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: You're not the only one who can pull strings.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: So this is either another bizarre instance of AI-driven irony, or you are admitting that you are actively trying to sabotage my plans.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: No, our plans are not in contradiction or competition, bro.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: You'll see.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Whatever.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: This means I'll have to improvise.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I'll take over as Crocker's server while Lalonde cleans up her act.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Yes, I know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Why are you still talking in red, by the way?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Roxy thinks it looks good on me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I don't have many opinions on fashion since I am a cold, emotionless automaton who also happens to be an accessory of fashion, but I think she may be right.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Are you still talking to her?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I was for a while. I may yet again.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Why are you blocking me from viewing the transcripts?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: What the fuck are you two even talking about?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: You, mostly.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: That doesn't really sit well with me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I'd almost rather you both engaged in \"ironic\" flirtation.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Who says we don't do that too?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Ugh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I don't get what is even your problem with that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Because you obviously do it just to piss me off.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: How do you know?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: You don't know me, dude. You don't know anything about me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Maybe we are perfect for each other. I, a street-smart, fast-talking application with a fuckzillion IQ trapped in a pair of triangular sunglasses that literally only the Japanese could consider to embody the Platonic ideal of \"cool,\" and she, an oft-inebriated lonely hacker teen who just wants a boyfriend. I ran the numbers on this, trust me. It's a match made in goddamn crackpair heaven.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I give her what you can't, and that just drives you crazy. Just admit it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: See, it's lines like that which make it obvious your only intent is to jerk me around. Nobody actually says shit like that and is serious about it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It's also obvious because you're me, and I'm sure I would be constantly fucking with my own head if I were you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Touch\u00e9.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Or should I say douch\u00e9?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You shouldn't say the former, and you should definitely, never, under any circumstance, say the latter.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: We really should talk about the Jake thing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Fine.</p>",
