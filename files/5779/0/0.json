BECAUSE OF YOU.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I can go back all the act act acts I want.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">The act act acts are kind of meaningless anyway.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Besides, trickster mode was getting obnoxious.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NO IT WASN'T!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yes it was.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Let's not do the Equius yes/no thing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">IT WAS GREAT.
