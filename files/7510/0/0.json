No, Arquius and I were just exchanging some notes 8efore I 8ring the meeting to order again.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: ok i just thought i would</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: saunter over here</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: things are getting pretty lalonde heavy over there</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: It really is an awful lot of fucking Lalondes, isn't it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: two was ok or actually cool even but this</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yeah</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: time to see whats up over here</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: how is it going there broquiusprite</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> Nearly finished radically downgrading crocker here</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> I then plan on mourning the complete restoration of her woeful inferiority with a moment of silent, subtle fle%ing</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: ok that was some weird stuff to say</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but cool</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: soooo</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: you are</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: some sort of freak right</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> Yes</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: ok good to know</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: its like</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: talking to someone who is half my bro...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but then not even really?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: the bro half is half AI or something??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: so maybe one quarter bro</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but then maybe even less because like alt-universe considerations and also part sprite</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> I am notorious for being <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arspritetxt_fucking.gif\"/> sensational at mathemati%, but I don't think I could break it down for you without lying about the precision of my figures</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> Which is a practice I am by no means above, mind you</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yeah the bottom line is i can tell youre just a really watered down version</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: or maybe</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: sweated down</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: why the fuck are you so sweaty</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> I'm not</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> I toweled off less than a minute ago</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: oh god</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> Sir Dave, there's much we could talk about, en route to wa%ing HARD sentimental about our dubiously shared fraternal past</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> The fact that I will not shouldn't be mistaken for preoccupation with this delicate cybertask, which is trivial to me since my mind is a faultless silicon mesh of living algorithmic perfe%ion</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> Neighther should it be ascribed to the fact that my troll hemidentity finds the notion of a reunion with you to be boring as a fiddling fruit</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> It is manely that such a bonding e%perience strikes me as an endeavor falling outside my totally ripped and kicktuchus purview</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> Brothertimes with Real Dave would best be left to the custody of Real Dirk, not to mention someone who gives at least greater than half a stupid shoot about you</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: (Swoon.)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: you know</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: im kinda glad you sound this insane and for the most part barely understandable</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: it makes it extra obvious you arent my legit bro</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: which means i can actually talk to you while only being like vaguely confused and unsettled instead of curling up into a ball and having some sort of social conniption</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: speaking of which</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: uh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: when is he supposed to get here btw</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Relax, Dave.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: He's scheduled to arrive around the same time as all the other 8ad guys.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: You still have time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I could have expedited his arrival, 8ut I knew that meeting him was going to 8e a 8ig deal for you, so I decided to let you have some space while we made some plans.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: See? I'm always thinking a8out what's good for you guys, and what's 8est for the overall strategy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Keeping everyone in high spirits is important!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: what do you mean</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: 'expedited'</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Never mind that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Just chill out!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: alright</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: so as long as im supposedly chillin and in no way wondering about my bro</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: are you SURE there are no beverages in that fridge</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: no aj or</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> It's a blind alley, brother dawg</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> I already asked if she had milk in there once, plus another nine redundant times after that</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> I also asked if she would like to touch my muscles</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> The answers were ten no's and one yes</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> That reminds me dave</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">ARQUIUSPRITE: <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png\"/> Would you like to touch my muscles?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: maybe later</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: so youre sure theres nothin to drink in there</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Yes, Dave.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: dunno why im so insistent</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: not like my fridge ever had anything comestible inside</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: why the fuck did you even bring it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Don't worry about it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: oh come on</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">TEREZI: G4MZ33'S 1N TH3R3</p>\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"http://mspaintadventures.com/scraps2/gamzsmallhonk.png\"/>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: oh right</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: somehow i forgot that we literally just established that you had gamzee locked in there for some reason</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: you sure we shouldnt maybe</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: let him out</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">TEREZI: &gt;:\\</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: he could suffocate in there</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">TEREZI: H3'LL JUST R3V1V3</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">TEREZI: GOD T13R STYL3, R1GHT?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: hes not a fuckin god tier</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: hes faking it he just made that fuckin suit from scratch or something</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i know hes complete trash but maybe we should just let him out</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: whats the harm its not like he can cause much trouble</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: we all way outnumber him and have way more powers and shit</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">TEREZI: UM...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: No.</p>",
