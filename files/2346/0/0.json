It contains a journal written by a young member of an alien species. She has documented her experiences playing the game you are about to play.\r<br/> <br/>You can only assume this took place a long time ago. This race is likely ancient, preceding yours by millions of sweeps. Maybe billions! You like to try to imagine the adventures of these players. Were they successful in repopulating their race? Did they manage to protect their matriorb and hatch a new mother grub? Could they hold it together, or were they torn apart by the complex social dynamics, the matespritships and moirallegiences and auspisticisms and kismesissitudes that will surely plague your group along the way?\r<br/> <br/>You have little doubt they succeeded with flying colors. </p>",
