It's 8een too long.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: yeah...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: actually hasn't it been exactly a year?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i think it was my birthday last time we met too, heh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: A year for you, may8e. Who even knows how long it's 8een out here, 8ut who cares.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: The point is, as you can see the plan I descri8ed to you 8efore is in full swing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: you mean the big treasure hunt, with all those black maps?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Yes. 8ut they aren't 8lack anymore! Not totally.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Everything's gone exactly as I intended. English has taken the 88, hook line and sinker.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: He's 8een chasing our \"extended party\" around the ring, 8lowing shit up with his monster 8reath, thus revealing the path to the treasure in the process.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I must say, for an evil mastermind, the guy is kind of a dope.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Supposedly his every move is a carefully calcul8ted ploy to assure his existence in the first place, yet here he is wrecking the joint like an oaf, unwittingly helping the hero find the weapon that will finally take him down.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: And we're almost there, too! Although 8y now it's 8ecome em8arrassingly o8vious that the treasure was hidden right around where we started all along.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: These maps have just 8een leading us all in a 8ig stupid circle!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I should have seen it coming. I guess that's my 8ad. In terms of 8onehead moves, that's English: 1, Vriska: 1, so I guess we're even. 8ut may8e we don't have to mention that detail when we document my heroism in the annals of gr8tness.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: uh... mention what, exactly?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Exactly!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Haha, I almost forgot how deceptively quick you are on the uptake, John.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #a15000\">TAVROS: (tHAT'S NOT SO IMPRESSIVE,)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #a15000\">TAVROS: (i WAS CONFUSED BY WHAT YOU WERE SAYING, tOO,)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Tavros, if you're going to interrupt, don't mum8le. And even then, don't.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Anyway, I really don't mind the fact that these cryptic treasure maps have led us all on a wild honk8ird chase.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I've never once complained a8out a good long treasure hunt, and I'm not a8out to start now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: 8esides, with the way spacetime works out here, who can say for sure we would 8e a8le to find the treasure at all unless we traced this exact path?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: No8ody can say that, is who. Least of all English, who as far as I know, can't actually speak so much as issue 8lood curdling roars that cleave the found8tions of reality itself.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: You're of course welcome to join us on our adventure, for as long as you're asleep.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: We could use another hand on deck. I'll even give you a rank and title!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #a15000\">TAVROS: yOU GET TO BE LOWER THAN ME,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #a15000\">TAVROS: tHAT'S THE FAIREST RULE,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Wrong.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Tavros, who's the captain here?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Last time I checked, it wasn't Swa88y Nitram, Poopmaster Extraordinaire.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #a15000\">TAVROS: }:(</p>",
