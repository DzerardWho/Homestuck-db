Presumably they would drop grist and stuff when you kill them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Like treasure. And food products that restore your health. Or at least make you less hungry.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Haven't you ever played a video game, Jane?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Of course I have!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: That's cool. I haven't, since I am a pair of sunglasses, and communing with such simplistic software would be a trivial and hollow exercise for me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: But I know loads of stuff about games. Like the fact that you gotta kill monsters if you want to make progress.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: If not to snatch up the bitchin' loot, at least for the levels.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Levels?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: How are you going to get better at fightin' without killing monsters, Jane.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I think I've done a fair job of scaling my echeladder without resorting to the slaughter of innocent, fictional monsters, thank you very much.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Please.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: You've barely done any climbing at all. I'm talking about hopping more rungs than what playing a little prank on your dad or throwing your hat on the ground super hard is gonna get you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: You need battle experience to make some real headway. Like Jake.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I'm getting a little tired of various iterations of Dirk Strider telling me how I need to be more like Jake.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I know you think Jake is neat. I know all the Dirks just ADORE Jake! I GET IT!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Wow, chill out.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: This ain't about whatever stuff you're apparently fixin' to twist your shit in a pretzel over.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: You just need to get stronger, is all. Don't you think that's what your dad would want?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: You don't need to remind me about that. I'm suddenly having flashbacks to a few years ago when he would ambush me almost every day for a pointless round of strife.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Boy does getting swatted with brooms and having cakes shoved in your face get old fast.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Yeah, but in the process you got pretty handy with that fork/spoon thingy, didn't you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Well. Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I'm just saying, if you don't run into any monsters on this planet, I think I'm going to have to set the bunny to \"sparring mode\" to help you along.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I am not going to spar with Lil Sebastian!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: He is too quick and deadly to fight with.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: And also, too adorable. :B</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Ok. We'll see about that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: But in the meantime, we need to figure out a way to start harvesting grist.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Let's forget the car. But now that you have the wallet, you can grab much bigger things.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Big things have got to be worth more grist than all the picayune bullshit you keep around the house.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: There are some choice relics in this place. Some of it has to be worth a fortune, gristways.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: You could be right.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I will give it a try.</p>",
