I was hoping we could introduce ourselves to one another, and help orient an old friend of mine to the afterlife.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: Ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: Who is your friend?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: Another troll?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: She was supposed to 8e the empress of all trolls, actually.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: Wow.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: So she died before she could be the empress i guess?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Not exactly, since she pro8a8ly never would have 8een regardless.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: She didn't want the jo8.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: Why not?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Remem8er how I said each class had a duty to take care of the younger and more populous classes lower on the order?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Well, hers was the highest of all.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: She was the only one on the planet with such royal 8lood, aside from the sitting empress.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: As the heiress, she was meant for a position of incredi8le responsi8ility.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Once she claimed the throne, she would have to serve for many thousands of years, until the next successor was ready.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: Thats a hell of a long time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: I guess she wasnt into that?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: She had some pro8lems with authority.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: She despised the whole social order, really.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: I foolishly tried to convince her to honor her o8ligation, 8ut she wouldn't listen.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: She viewed the empress as a glorified slave.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: So she a8dicated, and fled to the moon to hide.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: I was the only one who knew of her plans. The rest of the world searched 8ut never found her.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: At the time, I was furious with her. 8ut I didn't turn her in.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Which in retrospect was a key decision that led us here.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: You mean it led to you being dead?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Yes, eventually.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: While she was there, she discovered an ancient device.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Inside the device was a game.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: She 8ecame o8sessed with playing it, 8ut needed our friends to agree to play first.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: She was not well liked 8y the others though. Old grudges and rivalries made it hard to convince them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: 8ut she is very devious, and knows how to trick people into doing what she wants.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: She even got me to agree, 8y promising she'd return to her place as the heiress when we finished playing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Needless to say, we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: She sounds like a handful.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: She's not all that 8ad though.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Well........</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: When you really get to know her.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: And when she's unarmed.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Which is........ pretty much never, now that I think a8out it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: ...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Ok, she pro8a8ly is all that 8ad.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: The point is, you have to know how to handle her.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Regal types can 8e very touchy, even the ones who seem to revel in anarchy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: 8ut if you know all the right things to say and do, she will happily hand over the keys to the kingdom, so to speak.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: After all, royalty is royalty.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">ARANEA: Just let me do the talking for a while, ok?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Did you hear that, Jake? Aranea wants to do the talking.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: I think your dead girlfriend might be starting to come out of her shell.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: (Heheheh.)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">JAKE: (Ok that was kinda funny.)</p>",
