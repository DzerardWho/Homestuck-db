VERY QUICKLY.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I thought you had given up on getting answers from me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NO. I JUST HAVE NOT HAD TIME.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THE BOMB COUNTDOWNS ARE GETTING SO SHORT. THIS IS GETTING HARD. IT'S NOT FAIR.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I really don't see how it's any less fair than being allowed to solicit the omniscient narrator of your quest for answers.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Nobody else who plays this game gets to do that. What makes you so special?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">BUT YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID I WAS SPECIAL.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I shouldn't have said that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Now you're strutting around, all thinking you're special.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I AM SPECIAL!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">LESS BULLSHIT. MORE ANSWERS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I HAVE COLLECTED MORE FROG MEN.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT DO THEY DO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Frog men???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You are getting really esoteric with your headcanons now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">MY WHAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">And what makes you so sure they are all men?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Have you sexed them?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">FUCK YOU. AND YOUR RIBALD INSINUATIONS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">MY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FROG MEN IS STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">No, I mean determined their sex.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Do you even know how?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I DON'T CARE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THEY'RE ALL MEN. BECAUSE I SAY THEY ARE. AND I WANT THEM TO BE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">IF I BELIEVE HARD ENOUGH IN THEM BEING MEN.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THEN THAT FACT BECOMES ABSOLUTELY INDISPUTABLE AS A PERMANENT MAN REALITY.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">It does?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">ARE YOU TELLING ME. THAT YOU HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE. THAT MY ENTOURAGE OF DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMEN.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">CONSISTS OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN BOYS???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">No.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I mean, I don't know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I'm not there, so I can't sex them to be sure.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YOU FUCKING PERVERT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">That's not what sexing means you little shit!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I'D LIKE TO CHANGE THE TOPIC. AWAY FROM THE LUST YOU ARE FEELING FOR MY HANDSOME FROG MEN.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I HAVE OBTAINED SOME STRIPE HATS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YELLOW STRIPE HAT. BLUE STRIPE HAT. RED STRIPE HAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT DO THEY DO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Why do you always want me to spoil stuff for you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Why can't you be at least a little scientifically inquisitive, and find out what they can do yourself?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Have you tried injuring blue stripe hat yet?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHY WOULD I HURT HIM. HE IS MY LOYAL MINION, ALBEIT ONE WHO IS OVERWEIGHT AND APPARENTLY USELESS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">ANYWAY. I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR SCIENCE. JUST TELL ME.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Fine.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Blue stripe hat randomly time travels somewhere if you injure him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Red stripe hat can also travel through time, but only using fire as a gateway.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yellow stripe hat is a tailor.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">A TAILOR.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YOU MEAN. SOMEONE WHO SEWS STUFF.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yes. A damn good one, too.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THAT'S NOT A POWER. IT'S MORE LIKE. A FUCKING HOBBY.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHICH HAS NO VALUE TO ME WHATSOEVER.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">If you want to be a bigshot time traveler, you're going to need a good tailor.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Everyone knows that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NO. MAKES NO SENSE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">What if some day you get some sweet new threads? Who will maintain your wardrobe for you??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Do you think you'll wear that tee shirt and those stupid suspenders all your life?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I WILL NEVER STOP WEARING MY AWESOME SUSPENDERS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NO ONE CAN MAKE ME. NOT EVEN MY TAILOR.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Whatever you say.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You're wasting time again. Better hurry up and conquer this planet so you can find Eggs.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Whoops. I mean purple stripe hat.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Forget I called him that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">OH. YES.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THESE NEXT FEW GUYS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I HAVE A FEELING. THE FARTHER I GO. THE MORE USEFUL AND EXCITING THE FROG MEN ARE STARTING TO BE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You won't be disappointed.</p>",
