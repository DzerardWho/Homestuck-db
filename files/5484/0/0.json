Barely a scratch on him!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Just please don't shoot him again, ok?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">WHY. IF YOU SAY HE'S IMMORTAL. THEN IT SHOULDN'T MATTER, RIGHT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yeah, I know what I said.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Alright, maybe he's not god tier. Who can really say for sure?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Just try giving the machine gun a rest for a while. He really wants to help you!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS FUCKER WON'T DIE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">He's a hilarious, rascally clown!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You know how it is with clowns.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">NO??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">They are notoriously difficult to kill for reasons that basically don't make any sense.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I'm personally not aware of a single timeline in which this codpiece packing moron dies.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">WHAT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">It means you can't keep down the clown.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">??????</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Say it with me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">\"You can't keep down the clown.\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">NO, I WON'T SAY THAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">SAY IT!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">\"You can't...\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">GO FUCK YOURSELF. JUST TELL ME WHAT IT MEANS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">It means crazy clowns just won't die for some reason. In adventures such as yours, they tend to linger long past their welcome.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">They linger and linger and linger, and just when you think you're totally fed up with their bullshit and you can't take another second of it, they just linger some more.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">And you never know what they're up to, and they're always scheming in the shadows, and it's quite possible that whatever master plan they're hatching just doesn't make the slightest bit of sense at all.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">But it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how stupid the clown's schemes are, or how sick of him everybody is.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">He just. Won't. Die.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">THIS IS. HONESTLY? THE WORST SALES PITCH FOR A MENTOR. THAT I HAVE EVER READ.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Granted!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">But come on. Just let it slide this one time? Please?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Just no more shooting. You can slap him around if you want. That's fine. But shooting is off limits.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">WHY.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Because you can't kill him! He's the most important character in...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">IN WHAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Well, ok. Maybe not the MOST important.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">But he's still really important!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #323232\">I SERIOUSLY THINK. YOU'VE BEEN MOSTLY FUCKING WITH ME.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">No way!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Ok, shhhh! Shh. He's approaching you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Come on man, be cool. Let's just see how this plays out.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">It looks like he's got a present for you! Ooh, I wonder what it could be...</p>",
