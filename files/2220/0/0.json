Not the team full of degenerates with swill coursing through their veins. You're starting to get worked up again.\r<br/> <br/>Routine helps calm you down. Maybe you will talk to another friend. You talk to him every day for some reason. Though it's not exactly right to call him a friend, since you despise him. Your relationship with the fellow is difficult to describe.\r<br/> <br/>It should be noted that in troll language, the word for friend is exactly the same as the word for enemy.</p>",
