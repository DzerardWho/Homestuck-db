#e00707\">DAVE: like actually MASTERING time travel</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: im pretty sure what that involves is</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: learning to never use it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: see its like karate</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: well</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: its more like what they SAY about karate</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: that you learn it so you dont use it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but i mean we all know the truth about karate is if you know karate then obviously in reality you use it all the time</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: like doing lethal fuckin crane kicks and sweet karate chops while walking down the street just cause you can</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: its a god damn no brainer thats what you do with karate</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but see with time travel</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: all the stuff about learning it so you dont have to use it is true</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: theres no good that can come of it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: you can crunch the logic on the loops all you want</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but all youre doing is painting yourself into a corner</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: creating inevitabilities you have to rehearse and enact or face death for yourself or everyone you know</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: and sometimes facing death is the very inevitability you have to rehearse</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: and then you wait and wait knowing its coming and knowing it has to happen</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: how do you think it made me feel when we were gathering up all those frogs</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: and i knew the whole time in a little while you would have to watch me get shot</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but i couldnt say anything or it would mess it all up</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: all cause i thought it would be cool to be marty mcfuckin fly</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but instead of shredding johnny b goode on guitar to get my parents to bang</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: my crowning performance was doing a funny dance while getting pumped full of lead</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">......</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: then i had to leave everyone behind and get into the delorean and return to the 1980s</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but the delorean was actually a big purple moon</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: and the 1980s was me accidentally reaching god tier and living on a shitty meteor for a while</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: and i guess rose was doc brown</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: doc brown accidentally reached god tier too</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: ok i guess this is where the analogy falls apart but you get what i mean</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">sorry dave, you lost me there after the part where i shot you</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: damn</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: ok lemme start over</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">omg, no!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">the fact is youre going to have to rely on those powers if you want to stand any chance against a lord of time</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">it is safe to expect he can only be challenged by someone with a similar command over the aspect</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: why is that safe to expect</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: where are all these presumptions coming from</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: if you can use swords why dont you take the welsh cueball sword and fight him yourself</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i bet you could fuck him up</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: youre probably even more extra strong now that youve succumbed to the bark side</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: did you ever think about that</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">dave i am perfectly aware of the awesome powers granted to me by the bark side</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">it does not matter</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">i cant be the one to wield your sword against english</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">it has to be you</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">it is the will of the empress, and thats final</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: the empress can suck it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i have no intention of fighting him</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: and this isnt even me pulling more lame self aware reluctant hero junk</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i am just straight up not going to do it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: see thats not reluctance its just petulant refusal on my part</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: reluctant hero shit is when the guys like aw shucks i dunno if i wanna but deep down we all know he really does</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but i really dont</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: why should i</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i dont give a damn about lord english or his nebulous atrocities out in nowherespace</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: what kind of villain is someone you never met who hardly did anything evil to you or your friends directly</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: or even to anyone in your universe for that matter other than through some vague insidious influence</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: who even is this guy and why should i hate him</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: am i really supposed to be pissed off at a green muscle monster i never met</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: cause i aint pissed off at no muscle monster</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: hell wasnt he in some ass backwards way responsible for us existing in the first place?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: or all of humanity for that matter??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: maybe i should thank him before chopping him up via welshscalibur</p>",
