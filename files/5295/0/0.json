when you're busy and on dates and stuff? i just happen to have respect for something called PERSONAL BOUNDARIES, jade.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: and it's not like there's really anyone else to talk to, except the inscrutable chess people and a bunch of brainless consorts and an idiot cat princess. oh and also nanna, but i mean, she's my grandmother, and she's great, but a guy can only spend so much quality time with his grandmother before he starts to feel like kind of a loser whose friends are too busy to spend time with him!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: john... if you told me this earlier i would have...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: and i still never visit any interesting dream bubbles, and we can't even finish our cool planet quests because the moment we broke through the window all our denizens decided to go back to sleep, and...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i guess what i'm saying is, i'm MORE than ready to get to the other window and meet our friends and other new people and stuff.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: are you sure you can't make the ship go faster???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: were already going as fast as i can make us go</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: and how fast is that again?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: about the speed of light!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: well, can't you use your space powers and bump it up a notch?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: no! nothing can go faster than light john</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: unless you teleport of course</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: and why can't you teleport us again?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: i already explained this! i cant do that here, its not within the domain of the green sun which gives me those powers!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: is that why we can't go faster than light either?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: no thats just a regular law of physics!!! jeez</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: ok, i mean, i know that. but this isn't really a regular place, right?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: isn't the speed of light like a thousand miles a second? so what does that really mean here? are miles and seconds the same here as on earth? how does this nonsense dimension we're racing through jive with all the relativity mumbo jumbo?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: ok first of all, thats not even close to the speed of light</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: light travels at a hundred and eighty six thousand miles per second no matter what frame of reference youre in... even this one!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: second of all special relativity and comparing laws of physics between different frames of reference, those are tricky issues to talk about!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: but id be more than happy to talk about them if youd like. actually i would enjoy that because i never really get to talk about science wi...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: no, i don't want to talk about physics! i don't know anything about the laws of physics, because they are hard and boring.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i simply would like them to behave in a way that is most convenient to ME and MY LIFE! is that really asking too much?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: yes as a matter of fact it is!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: well, guess what? SCIENCE IS STUPID BULLSHIT!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: you take that back!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: no.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: magic is awesome.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: science blows.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: the end.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: john.....</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: what is that?</p>",
