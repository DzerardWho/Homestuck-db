All the 8etter reason to let me use it!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but there are a lot of ghosts!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i'm just not sure what to do yet.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: W8. You're not ACTUALLY thinking of giving it to someone else, are you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: That's my ring! The orange guy gave it to ME!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: yeah, well frankly, i don't give a shit about the orange guy!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: the ring is mine for now, so i'm the one who has to figure out what to do with it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: speaking of waking up, it's probably time i got going too.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i'm not trying to join the mutiny or anything, but i do have friends waiting for me out there.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: John, w8!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I hope we're not parting on 8ad terms here.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: You aren't holding all this treasure hunting shit against me like Tavros is, right?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: We're still cool, right John?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: uh...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: If you have to leave, I get that, 8ut I really want us to stay friends!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I always felt like we had a special 8ond, John. Like we're 8oth always in the position of having to take charge as leaders, even if we never asked for that responsi8ility.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: And I don't wanna pressure you into anything, 8ut I would really appreci8 it if you'd at least think a8out me next time you take a nap with that ring on!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: it's fine. we can stay friends.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i don't really like to make enemies with people, even if they're...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Even if they're what?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: umm.</p>",
