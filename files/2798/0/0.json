He was just as easily bested by this crafty old prankstress!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: really?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: Yes. It would be many years before he would take the gambit in an exchange with your nanna.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but nanna, did you know he is not really my dad? and also, i am not technically your grandson.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: you are actually sort of my mother.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: Of course I knew this, John! I have known for many years.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: I have also known that in a sense, you are my father as well. You were the one to push all those buttons, after all!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: huh, oh yeah.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: don't you find it all a little strange?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: John, I am the ghost of an old lady with one arm who is dressed like a clown. Why would that seem strange to me?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: heheh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: so where have you been, nanna? i have been looking all over for you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">NANNASPRITE: I have been looking for you too, dear!</p>",
