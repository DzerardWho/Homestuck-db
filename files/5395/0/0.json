Constell8tions used to have a lot of significance in our culture, not just guiding explorers on their journeys to physical destin8tions, 8ut guiding them on the choices they made in life, pertaining to f8 and all that. Not that humans would really understand anything like that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I actually find the situ8tion to 8e pretty funny. This guy's ego must 8e astronomical. Classic case of unchecked hu8ris paving the way for his own downfall.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I didn't even need to 8uild a we8 to trap him. He just went ahead and started 8uilding his own.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Talk a8out a lucky 8r8k!!!!!!!!</p>",
