#0715cd\">EB: i was just looking at all these rascals, and i was wondering...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: how they go back in time and become us and stuff.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: does it have something to do with the reckoning?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: you told me.</p>\n<p style=\"color:

style=\"color: #626262\">CG: ANYWAY, HOW COULD WE HAVE MADE A DARE IF I'M MOVING BACKWARDS ON YOUR TIMELINE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: YOU WOULD DARE ME TO DO SOMETHING, THEN I WOULD DO IT NEXT TIME, BUT THEN YOU WOULDN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE DARE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: BECAUSE WE DIDN'T MAKE IT YET.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #626262\">CG: THAT'S WHAT ISN'T TRUE AND DOESN'T MAKE SENSE YOU DAMP BAG OF PUKE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: well yeah, the dare never happened, i was joking around and made that up to give you hard time.</p>\n<p style=\"color:
