All the cosmic mayhem is really quite pretty.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Almost like the 8ig man out there is putting on a fireworks display, just for us.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: daw</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: lord muscleguy be thoughtful as fuck</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: How far do you think he'll go?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: To find... who was it? His \"kid sister\"?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Is he really going to keep smashing the 8lack space forever until he finds her, til it's all gone?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Is it actually POSSI8LE to shatter a continuum that's theoretically infin8te?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: shrug</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Like I said.

May8e he THINKS he has. In the way that totally delusional, egomaniacal people tend to do.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I 8et he never had anyone in his life who was actually important to him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Someone who could have helped him see that nothing is worth that kind of o8session.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: That it's 8etter to just try and 8e happy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: poor skull guy 38(</p>",
