#e00707\">DAVE: some kind of brainwashing thing going on</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: gotta keep em napping</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: especially jade im sure you know what kind of crooked ass baloneyfuck powers she got</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: cant let her turn those against us</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: right.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: she should be pretty psyched to see you though</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: you think?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yeah</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: um</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i dunno if you know this or not but</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: apparently along the way our version of john died</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: so she made the whole trip without you</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: oh no!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yeah this timeline was gearing up to be pretty tragic i guess but then you sorta deus exxed out of nowhere and spared us those sadtimes</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i mean from your point of view i guess it isnt deus ex shit you were just the normal john you always were all zipping around like a nerdy hypergod saving everything from whatever</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but from our standpoint you just kinda yanked yourself out of random ass nothing but hey you know what ill take it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: man.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i had no idea.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i guess that's what typheus meant?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: that's so sad...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: poor jade!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i can't believe she had to spend all that time on the ship thinking i was dead...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i mean, i guess i WAS dead. but...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: you know what i mean.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: are you sure we can't wake her up for a second, just so she can see i'm alright?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: &gt;::::|</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: feel free but i have a feeling youll just be joining her nap if you try</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: darn.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i guess we'll have to catch up later.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: hey, what about dave sprite?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: dead</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: noooo!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: that sucks too!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yeah</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i guess so</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: you guess??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: its a weird subject for me</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: like</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: the guy was always on borrowed time wasnt he</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i mean that was his whole \"thing\" right</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i dunno.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i'll miss him anyway, even if he isn't the \"real dave\".</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i kinda feel bad for ever thinking of him as a less real version, actually.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yeah hes me and exactly what i would be like if i was a moping existential bird so its kind of embarrassing to even talk about ok</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i guess it is \"\"\"sad\"\"\" but you know a lot of versions of me have died</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: lots of versions of all of us including you</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: isnt whats important that certain dubiously categorized iterations of ourselves are all alive here and now and hanging out</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: yeah, that is what's important!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i guess there will be time to reflect on everything that was lost later, like dead time clones and double dead ghosts, or other such hogwash.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: right now i'm still so excited to see everybody.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: there's so much crazy stuff for us all to catch up on...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i don't even know where to start, it's overwhelming!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: dont stress over it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: we still have some time to kill before shit starts getting real in this session</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: at least according to our vriska in chief</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: what do you mean?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: all the bad guys are still just outside the incipisphere</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: they wont converge here until a few hours or so</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: so lets all just sit back a while and shoot the shit</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: and i do mean empty our clips into the shit, like really pump that turd full of lead</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: right up until she gets bossy again and commandeers our fly brotimes with more shrill tactical exhortations</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: ok, that sounds great!</p>",
