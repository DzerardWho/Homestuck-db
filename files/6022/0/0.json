WHY DID THAT PLANET GIVE ME TWO ELVES.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You're calling them elves now?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YES.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">But they're leprechauns!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Or gnomes, according to some baloneyscholars.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THEY CAN NOW BE ADDITIONALLY REFERRED TO AS ELVES. I HAVE DECIDED.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Whatever.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHY ARE THERE TWO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Because of the two for one deal.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You sunk the 7th planet on the break. So when you destroyed the 6th planet, you unlocked both the 6th and 7th elf.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Now you're on the 8th planet. This one doesn't give you an elf.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">IT DOESN'T.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">No.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT ABOUT A GNOME.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">No.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT ABOUT A LEPRECHAUN.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">No.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You get nothing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHY NOT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Because you're supposed to skip this one and destroy it last.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You're just wasting time hanging around here. The clock is ticking.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">ALRIGHT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">BUT FIRST. I WANT TO GET THEIR POWERS STRAIGHT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">AM I CORRECT IN ASSUMING. THEIR POWERS KEEP GETTING MORE USELESS?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">JUST AS I SUSPECTED.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I DON'T EVEN CARE ANYMORE. I JUST WANT TO KNOW.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">SO ORANGE HAT. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED. JUST WALKS AHEAD OF ME ALL THE TIME.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NO MATTER HOW FAR OFF HE WANDERS. AND GETS LOST. I ALWAYS SEEM TO CATCH UP WITH HIM.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">AND GREEN HAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">HE JUST HAS A DOLL. WITH PINS IN IT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT'S UP WITH THAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">He has a doll with pins in it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">AND??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Every time you get a new elf, he'll take another pin out.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">That's all I will tell you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">OK. GOT IT. IT'S POINTLESS. MOVING ON.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">MAROON HAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I CAN'T TELL WHAT HIS POWER IS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT IS HIS POWER.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">He doesn't have a power.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">No.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THAT'S A NEW LOW. EVEN FOR THESE SHIT HEADS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">But maroon hat is pretty smart!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You can use him as a higher ranking henchman or something.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">BEING SMART ISN'T A POWER.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">PLUS. I DOUBT IT. HOW SMART CAN ONE OF THESE IMBECILES BE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You should talk to him and find out.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Come on.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Just a little friendly chat.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">FINE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I WILL HAVE A WORD WITH HIM. VERY BRIEFLY.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Hey.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Are you still talking to him?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Wow, you guys are really going at it there.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">What the fuck could you be talking about for so long?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">This is getting ridiculous.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">The timer on the next cueball bomb is ticking away.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">OK. I'M BACK.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">And?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">MAROON HAT IS HIGHLY INTELLIGENT AND PERSONABLE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I HAVE DECIDED HE IS MY FAVORITE GUY SO FAR.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">See? I told you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I WILL GIVE HIM SOME IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITIES LATER.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">BUT I HAVE NOT DECIDED WHAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Maybe he can hold on to something important for you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">GOOD IDEA.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">LIKE WHAT?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">OH, I KNOW. MY CALTOP.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">No not the caltop. That's dumb.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">MY GUN?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">No.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">OH! MY CANDY.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">No you idiot!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">FUCK YOU. IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA. THEN JUST TELL ME WHAT IT IS. PUZZLEMAN.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Look at the color of his hat. What else do you have that's that color?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">UHH.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Also, what object can you think of that's kinda shaped like a 7?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">HMM.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">OH!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">OHHHHHHHHHHH.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">OF COURSE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">A BOOMERANG!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Ok, I give up.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I WILL MAKE A MENTAL NOTE TO SECURE A BOOMERANG IN THE FUTURE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YES. IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE. TO BE A BOOMERANG. THEMATICALLY.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">BECAUSE IT ALWAYS COMES BACK AROUND. IN ONE BIG CIRCLE. LIKE ALL THE TIME SHIT. I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">OK. LAST QUESTION.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHY IS PURPLE HAT. CONSTANTLY DANCING IN MY PRESENCE?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yeah.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I guess in retrospect, purple hat has always been pretty flirtatious, hasn't he?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT?!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Maybe you should try to be open minded though.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Have you ever considered a <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/star-heart-horseshoe.png\"/> relationship with someone?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Maybe you will discover you have never truly experienced joy until you have been in <img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/star-heart-horseshoe.png\"/> with a dancing elf.</p>\n-- Caliborn has spiked his caltop on the ground in disgust. --</p>",
