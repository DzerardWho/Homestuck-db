    "pesterlog": "-- grimAuxiliatrix <span style=\"color: #008141\">[GA]</span> began trolling tentacleTherapist <span style=\"color: #b536da\">[TT]</span> --\n\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Your Dark Spectacled Friend Has Advised Me On A More Effective Method For Trolling You</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Think His Contention Is That This Strategy Will Have The Opposite Of The Intended Effect And Precipitate A Sort Of Bond Between Us That Is Established In Mutual Antagonism</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: What Do You Think About This</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I think you're shrewd to have recognized his ploy of sabotage, and you've earned my compliments.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Ah See It Is Working Already</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: What is?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Ive Listened To His Advice</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: And Have Resolved To Modify The Approach Slightly</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Know What I Have To Do</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: What We Have To Do Really</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: What's that?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Remember The First Time We Spoke</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Yes, but you said it wasn't the first time you spoke to me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: We'll graciously omit my embarrassing skepticism however.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: The First Time You Spoke To Me Was The Second Time I Spoke To You</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: This conversation doesn't sound like your first time either.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: This Is Your Second Conversation With Me But Is My Seventh With You</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: And when exactly does your maiden encounter take place?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Thats Next Time</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: So to clarify.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: If the matching of my first with your second is denoted by 1=2, then the sequence would be:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: 1=2, 2=7, 3=1, 4=?, ...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Yes And The Rest Of The Sequence Is Simply</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: 4=3, 5=4, 6=5, 7=6</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Unless My Future Self Stowed Another Conversation In Between One Of Those Which Is Entirely Possible</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: But Urrgh I Dont Want To Think About That</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Why is it that when the subject of temporal mechanics is broached your sparing troll intellects etcetera etcetera.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: See That Is What I Mean Rose You Are Not As Dumb Of A Girl As I Was Initially Lead To Believe</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: You mean based on the first impression I am apparently about to make in our next conversation?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Yes</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: What could I possibly say that will leave such an imprint?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: That Is Why I Have Contacted You Now</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Will Send You A Copy Our First Conversation Directly From My Chat Log</p>\n\n-- grimAuxiliatrix <span style=\"color: #008141\">[GA]</span> sent tentacleTherapist <span style=\"color: #b536da\">[TT]</span> the file \"ConversationWithAVeryStupidGirl.Txt\" --\n\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I guess being forced to cooperate with a stable time loop is the only plausible explanation for my remarks.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Yes And Then I Found It Sort Of Curious That During My Next Conversation With You Your Various Mental Endowments And Wherewithals Were Not As They Seemed</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Suspected The Stratagem Might Be A Counter Trolling Measure But Then Was Not So Sure And Further Examination Grew Warrant</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: And what if my counter-counter measure is to choose not to transcribe this dialogue accurately in the future-first place?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: But See I Have Edited The Copy Already In Ways That Will Remain Secret For Now But You Will Discover Once You Type It</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: So You Are Destined To Edit It No Matter What And What You Submit Will Be What I Once Read Regardless</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: !</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Unless I decide to copy it word-for-word!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Yes Unless I Lied About Editing It In The First Place</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Either Way Through Knowledge Of What You Will Say I Have Precisely Engineered The Nature Of Your Transgression</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: !!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: So your trolling strategy now is to put idiotic words in my mouth through the machinery of temporal inevitability, and cause me to excruciate over how to subvert the transcription?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Yes</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: While being perfectly up front about it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Yes I Suppose Its That Sarcasm All The Time Seems Laborious To Me</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I'll admit, it's a more advanced tactic than I gave you credit for.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Yes And The Providence Of This Antagonism Ninja Vice Grip Pinching Your Larynx Has Already Begun To Supply My Purpose With Fruit</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: The Chilly Frost Shimmering On Our Tree Of Human Friendship Has Begun To Thaw</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Mixed metaphor aside, usually ninjas don't announce what they're doing when they're doing it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Like when stalking an emperor to assassinate him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Or befriend him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: But that's fine.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I guess the only pointless question we haven't exhausted is, why?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Why the convoluted artifice?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Dave Raised Insight Into The Human Psychology Of Friendship Development</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: By Allotting You Your Side Of The Conversation I Have You At The Disadvantage In Your View And You Will Seek To Reclaim Higher Ground</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: In Successive Conversations</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: 4=3 And 5=4 And Such</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Your Demeanor Will Be Terse If Not Saturated With Disdain And It Will Cause Me To Be Confused And Question Your Motivation</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: But Now I Know Your Motivation Because I Am Supplying It Here And Now</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: They Will Be Simple Acts Of Friendly Human Retaliation</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: So you're not only rigging the first impression I make on you, but orchestrating my revenge for the rigging as well?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Yes</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: It Seems Friendship For Some Humans Is A Basic Aggregation Of Shallow And Insincere Hostilities</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: That's an interesting take on it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: But now I know for sure Dave isn't behind this plan.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It's too complicated.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Dont Understand</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Who Better To Coordinate Such Events Than The Knight Of Time</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: You're awfully quick to his defense.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Are you sure you don't have a thing for him?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It's ok, bro. You can admit it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I'm Hopping To 8=8</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Ideally You Will Have Long Since Discarded This Train Of Thought</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I'm going to talk to my dead cat.</p>",
