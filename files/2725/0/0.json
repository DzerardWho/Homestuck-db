And then fly up. It's right here on your timeline. 8y attempting to do the thing you're not supposed to do yet, you are just wasting more of our time!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: jeez!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: you are incredibly bossy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: more like marquise bossyfangs.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I told you, that's my role playing name, not my real one! So your weak 8urn means nothing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: no, you did not tell me that you like to play troll dungeons and dragons.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Oh, yes John. I am really going to know what that stupid Earth game is, just 8ecause you put troll in front of it. Stupid.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i will find out what your name is, i am tricky and i have ways.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Pffffffff, dou8t it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Now shut up and do what you are going to do next!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i don't know what i'm going to do next!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: apparently what i thought i was going to do next was wrong, so why don't you tell me?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ecause.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: That's ridiculous!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: That would 8e a ridiculous way for us to do things.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: has it occurred to you that i might be wasting so much time because you keep pestering me telling me how much time i'm wasting?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: and then when i'm about to make progress you tell me i am doing the wrong thing!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: if it weren't for you i would be playing this game already.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Okaaaaaaaay, shut up!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Fine. I will hold your hand every step of the way, since that's apparently how you want to do this.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: but it isn't!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I said shut up!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Look, you are a8out to make yourself a new outfit, and THEN you will fly up and install the game.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: oh...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: but why would i do that? my ecto labsuit is rad!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ecause you look like an idiot!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: :(</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Seriously, it's a good thing I did decide to 8other you now. Otherwise you would go through the game looking like a little weenie 8oy-Skylark.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: what is a boy skylark?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: It is the most terri8le, gutless class for wimpy losers, ones who have no idea how to handle themselves when a girl talks to them and stuff.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: actually, i think i remember passing that rung on my echeladder a while ago.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yes, exactly! It is 8eneath you, John.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: You are clearly much 8etter than that. You should dress like it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: who cares what i dress like? it is what's inside the adventurer that counts.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Hahahahahahahaha!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I watched you actually say that with a str8 f8ce. Oh my god.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: why are you taking such an interest in my fashion, anyway?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Trolls are an extremely fashion-minded race, John. You should make a note of this, since you pretend to 8e a scientist or something.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: ha ha, it sounds like you have a really lame culture.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: John, that is an outr8geous thing to say. You don't even know how important the fashions are, so 8e quiet.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: laaaaaaaame.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Look at that! You counted out 8 a's for me, John! That is so thoughtful of you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: oh, ha ha...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i didn't even count. it just...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: turned out like that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Really????????</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: yeah.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: &lt;33333333</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: er...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: ok, anyway, i will make a new suit, but i am not ditching my ectosuit!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: it is so sweet, i look like link, if zelda was a quest about an elf scientist.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i am the wind waker. it's me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I know you are, John.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Now empty out your sylladex and let's see what sort of killer gear we can make for you. 8ut do it fast!</p>",
