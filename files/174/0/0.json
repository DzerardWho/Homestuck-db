I keep losing the wireless signal.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Must be the weather.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I would look for a stronger signal in another part of the house, but I'd rather not risk an encounter with my mother.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I battled through her cloud of gin and derision once already this evening.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: haha, yeah I hear you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Yes.
