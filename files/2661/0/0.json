She sort of reminds me of my goo8er teamm8.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: He napped through most of the adventure, and was practically useless.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: oh...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: you mean carcino geneticist?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Hahahaha, no way! Karkat is so up tight, he hardly slept a wink over the whole 600 hour span of our quest.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: He didn't even wake up on the moon until AFTER we won the game, hahahahahahahaha.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: What a loser.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: heheh. car cat. that is how i am saying that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: beep beep, meow!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i will have to remember to give him a hard time about that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: John, you are pretty weird! I can see why you would piss him off so much.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: it is really not hard to do that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Tell me a8out it!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Speaking of telling me a8out things...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Why don't you tell me what you were just dreaming a8out that was so important, fellow Prospit dreamer????????</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Prospit is the 8est. Derse is where all the rejects hang out. Am I right?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i never even saw prospit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: aside from flaming bits and pieces of it i guess.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: something happened, and it blew up, and dream jade died, and then i was wandering around this place that was like a chess board with a huge crater in it, with loads of dead black and white guys everywhere.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yes, I know all that! That place is the 8attlefield, which is where your dream self lives now. You will appear there any time you go to sleep.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Prospit dreamers are supposed to end up there eventually. If they're any good, that is. ::::)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ut you got there so much sooner. Normally a dreamer's journey to the 8attlefield will not 8e so spectacularly sudden and violent. Meteoric, if you will!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: oh, huh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ut you didn't answer my question! What was so important that you wanted to go 8ack to sleep again for?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: my dad was there.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: What's that?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: um, you know...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: my guardian?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Oh, you mean the adult male human who lived in your hive?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: yes. if by hive you mean house.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Haha, I was wondering a8out that. I was like, what the hell is this guy doing in this kid's hive? Where is his lusus? Is he an orphan contending with some sort of meddlesome grownup squatter????????</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: um...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: these observations are very alien of you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: but that's pretty cool i guess, seeing as you are an alien.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yes, I just chalked it up as generic alien weirdness and didn't think too much a8out it. Just another series of strange exhi8its from an inferior civiliz8tion.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: the funny thing is, he is not even really my dad.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i mean, i was adopted by him, although we are not actually unrelated, i think.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: he is the son of my grandmother, who isn't really my grandmother...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: nanna is sort of like my biological mother, and my biological father would be jade's grandpa, sorta.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: both of which i just created, with slime and stuff, and sent back in time as babies.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: so i guess, if anything, that makes my dad...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: my half brother???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: ::::\\</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: tell me about it!</p>",
