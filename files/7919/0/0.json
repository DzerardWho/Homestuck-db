Whatever. I'm still not sure whose lightning round it is when you're the one asking questions.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: dunno ask roxy</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Ok. Anyway, didn't mean to interrupt.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but yeah we would send each other stuff sometimes</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: me and john</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: well we all would</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: usually absurd birthday packages and such</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: We did that too.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Except I had to send things through time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Always had to figure out stuff small enough to send through the sendificator, even if it was piece by piece.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: nice</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: one time it turned out we ACCIDENTALLY sent presents through time</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i mean not literally, more in a roundabout way</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: we all sent john a rabbit</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but all three rabbits just turned out to be the same damn rabbit</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: because of stupid time shit</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Once I deliberately and quite literally sent a rabbit through time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: It was a robot.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: wow</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: He was a loyal friend to Jane. I don't know what happened to him though.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yeah i dunno what happened to johns rabbits either</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: rabbits am i right</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: I hear you, man.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: what next</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Hm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: You say he owned Cal as well?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yep</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Did he come down to Earth on a meteor with Cal too?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i think so</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: that was a long time ago</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: kinda weird to imagine him strutting around with that puppet as a kid in the 80s</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: or maybe just kinda funny actually</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: he sure held on to it a long time</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: must have gotten attached at a really early age and just never let go</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i guess you fell to earth with one of those things too?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Yeah.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: But if I came to Earth on a meteor the same way you all did, then I guess I just got dunked right in the fucking ocean.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Which makes sense. One of my earliest memories is of using Cal as a flotation device.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: So he sorta saved my life in a way. I guess I bonded with him too, the way your bro did, even if that sounds a bit stupid.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Then again, it didn't help matters much that I lived alone in the middle of the ocean. He was my only real life friend. I mean, until I built some new ones.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: hmm wait we fucked up</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i asked you a question its not my turn</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: keep firing</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: How did your bro die?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: he died fighting one of these jacks</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: at this point i almost forget which one</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: no wait</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: ok yeah it was the omnipotent dog one</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: the jack from our session</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: he was fighting like a lesser form of him and then jack got extra prototyped by dog powers and then got outmatched and stabbed with his own sword</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: pretty sure davesprite was fighting with him and almost died too but then it turned out he didnt</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but now im at least 99% sure that davesprite is DEFINITELY dead and wont suddenly reappear as a stupid surprise or anything</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: I hate stupid surprises.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: word</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: So, you said he \"trained\" you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: I'm guessing that means he knew what was coming?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Or, some things about your future, at least?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: seems that way</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: not sure what he knew or how he knew it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: all our guardians seemed to know bits and pieces of stuff and did vague mysterious things to prepare</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: to this day i have no idea if he was training me to fight lord english or if he even knew who that guy was on any conscious level</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: or it was more like general purpose training to be able to survive some hard shit after the end of the world happened</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: youd have to ask him but thats impossible</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i do know he managed to get the drop on a meteor before i entered the game</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: What?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: as far as i can tell he stood on top of it and split it in half with his sword</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Um,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Not to be too much of a wet blanket on that rad as fuck anecdote, but that sounds kind of far fetched.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yeah it does doesnt it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but then again so does a baby getting dunked from space in the ocean then floating on a weird doll and then growin up by himself with no adults around</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: That's not far fetched. It was pretty straightforward.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: I think I just found a building poking out of the water, climbed up, then I just started foraging for food in there like a feral infant.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Supplies which I'm sure your adult self must have left behind for me, seeing as he clearly must have known some things about the future too.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Speaking of which, maybe it's your turn now?</p>",
