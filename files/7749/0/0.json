i guess i convinced myself they were all in the same boat as me</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but thats not how it was</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: their complaints were trumped up nonsense and i bought it cause... i dunno</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i didnt have any frame of reference</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but his dad and her mom no matter what they said it was so obvious they cared about them deeply</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: even jades weird fuckin grandpa who died when she was young obviously would have done anything for her</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: why did i get such a raw cut of the asshole deck</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: and why did it take me so long to figure that out</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: and like hes dead now so thats that</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: so all thats left to do is look back and try to put the pieces together of my first 13 years</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: and all i can think is what the fuck WAS that?!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i dont come away with the impression i used to try convincing myself of, that he was like \"mysterious\" or \"stern\" or \"aloof\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: the only feeling left is this insane impression that i was raised by somebody who fuckin HATED me</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: and the whole act of even \"raising a child\" was some totally fucked up game to him</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: like parenthood was one of the highest tiers of irony in his solemn bullshit bro-ninja code</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: so he went through those motions and did whatever he thought was \"funny\" or \"badass\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but under that weird stylistic and totally sociopathic approach to parenting i cant even IMAGINE there was any emotion toward me other than some sort of loathing</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: What...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Did he do?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i dont want to get out the laundry list</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but for reference laundry wasnt one of those things</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: that was just one of the many little domestic things i just had to sort of FIGURE OUT</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: sorta like i eventually had to learn what the REAL purpose of a refridgerator was from movies</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Wait.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: What??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i dunno theres too much to even get into</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: just</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i dont remember the atmosphere ever not being nerve wracking</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: all havin to sneak around and...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: ugh my shitty childhood spider senses are tinglin just thinking about it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: it was \"training\" you know</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but you know what it really was it was some vicious shit that was bad and sucked and i hated it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: it didnt make me stronger</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: it did the opposite</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: it made me never want to fight</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: it made me never want to see blood or be near danger or hear metal sounds</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: it made me hate the idea of being a hero cause he was a hero and he ruined the idea of heroism</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i dont even want to be fighting this shitty version of jack but hey nobody else has secret welsh powers so i guess i have to</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: ...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: what gets me is how long it took me to put all this together</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: to stop seeing it as some kinda roughhousey and eccentric life i had but was otherwise normal</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: it took years to deconstruct it all and put it back together to understand how fuckin mad i should be</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: and in particular how stone cold deeply uncared for i was my whole life</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: like... being merely \"monitored\" by a violent robot</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i only started getting it after spending a lot of time in person with a bunch of people who actually did care about me</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: and i could start feeling like</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: actually somewhat human for the first time</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: instead of...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: some sort of runty afterthought to a household cabal of smutty puppets</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: ... Puppets?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: the fuckin puppets!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i know how it sounds but i am NOT joking and there is NO shred of doubt in my mind that he loved all those puppets more than me</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: honestly it is very possible that he was just insane and thats that</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i guess it didnt help either that we lived with what we have come to understand may theoretically be the most evil doll to exist in any universe ever</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: in fact its my tenuous understanding that he came down to earth with that thing and like actually grew up with it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: maybe...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: maybe spending 30 some years being unseparable from that hell puppet had some effect on him??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: maybe if it hadnt been casting a pall over our apartment 24/7 since he took me in...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: grinning...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: glaring...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: laughing in my sleep...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: maybe our lives wouldnt have been quite so...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: maybe we would have...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: ugh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: What?</p>",
