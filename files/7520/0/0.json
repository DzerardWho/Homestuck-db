    "pesterlog": "<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Let's run down the threat list, with a full de8riefing on each threat.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: We'll start with the 8ig fish herself, the former empress of our world, Her Imperious Condescension.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: The only reason we've 8een a8le to temporarily neutralize her stranglehold on this session is 8y taking two major pieces away from her, Harley and Crocker.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Rest assured, she's already scheming to reassert her dominance, and if it weren't for my intervention here, I'd 8et everything I had on the sea witch.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: She's spent centuries upgrading her a8ilities which now include 8OTH kinds of telekinesis. The simpler variety more common to rust 8loods, and the nasty kind which sometimes yellow 8looded mutants have involving all the fucking eye lasers and shit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: If that weren't enough, she has a mix of telepathic a8ilities too, like mine, plus the animal communion kind more typical of 8rown 8loods.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">TAVROSPRITE: lIKE ME!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Yes Tavros, like you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: This means she can hijack animals AND trolls, assuming they aren't particularly resistant to influence, like me o8viously.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Humans I'm guessing are still off limits to her influence, unless they've got some animal 8lood in them, which is what makes Jade such a dangerous element here.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: One of the mission critical priorities is to make sure she stays asleep. If she ever wakes up, and the Condesce takes control again, that's pro8a8ly game over for you guys.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Jade's first guardian a8ilities make her too much to deal with on top of everything else.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: It's also possi8le that the Condesce may have some sway over the prospitian and one of the Jacks 8ecause of their part-dog n8ture too.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: It's hard to say what their level of resistance is, so I really can't 8e sure.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Strategically, it's 8est to err on the safe side though, and presume this could 8e an issue.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: This is why taking on the Condesce has to 8e a HUGE PRIORITY!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Ideally, you should 8e trying to kill or disa8le her as quickly as possi8le.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: 8ut if that's easier said than done, then what you need to do is keep her OCCUPIED!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Throw everything you have at her. Whatever crazy powers you've got.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Just keep her 8usy!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Distracted enough 8y a 8unch of pesky kids so she won't have time to get clever with her powers.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: This is the 8est defense against the off-chance she might 8e a8le to sway the dog Jack and prospitian, AND a failsafe in case Jade wakes up for whatever reason.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: When it comes to killing her, I don't have much to advise.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: There's no intel on her weaknesses or anything like that. In fact, I'd 8et she doesnt have any.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Like any powerful endgame 8oss, you just have to keep hammering away at her until she's dead.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Nuff said!</p>",
