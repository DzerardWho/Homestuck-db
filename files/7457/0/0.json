Long enough for me to have picked up the ha8it of calling them years instead of the far more sensi8le unit of measurement, sweeps.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I think you should 8e a8le to survive just a little longer.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i still dont understand whats supposed to happen</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: hes just supposed to like</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: appear?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: That's my understanding, yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: you mean</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: here</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: on this frog circle thing</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I don't know!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Somewhere in this session. At which point, if he has any 8rain at all, he'll seek us out.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: so jade came on a gold ship through a tiny window apparently</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but john wasnt on it??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Well, his corpse was, somewhere.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: 8ut that John doesn't matter anymore.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Kind of like how there was a 8ird version of you out there, now presumed dead, who also didn't matter.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: The \"real\" John and the other Lalonde girl will spontaneously appear from a different reality.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I determined a lot of this through my time travel reconaissance work upon arriving in this session.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Sorry to steal all the timey thunder from the gr8 \"Knight of Time\", end quote, 8ut someone had to take the initi8tive and go on a fact-finding mission.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: no its cool</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: you can have that thunder if you want it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: When exactly is this supposed to happen?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Soon!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: And she's...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: Unhurt?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: Will she remember our brief encounter?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: This is a totally different Lalonde girl. Things went differently for her, so she'll have different memories.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I have no idea if you and she interacted at all in her timeline.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I don't know the full extent of John's alt-reality experiences either. 8ut apparently things went raw for them in a8out as many ways as you can imagine.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Presuma8ly 8ecause I wasn't around to keep everyone's shit in order.</p>",
