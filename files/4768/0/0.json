He can 8e your assisted living slave. </p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I would have had the perfect candid8 all lined up, 8ut he recently lost the use of his legs unfortun8ly. Oh well, I'll just roll with the punches like I always do and find someone else.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Just say the word, and I'll make him do whatever you want! Read my awesome notes to you, hang some more plush dragons from your tree, pre-chew your food........</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Well, may8e not pre-chew it, since I didn't exactly knock your teeth out, did I?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: May8e more like pre-look-at your food, to make sure there are 8ugs in it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: See, isn't it gr8 when we're helping each other out instead of maiming each other repeatedly?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: This is how it should 8e 8etween Scourge Sisters. All the maimings and 8acksta88ings should 8e saved for the friends and foes who get in our way, don't you think?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Hey, what do you want to do for our next campaign, 8tw?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: We can take the next one easy. I'll try to think of something 8etter suited to your new disa8ility!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I mean, I've ALREADY pretty much nixed anything involving stairs, 8ecause of Tavros. Lol.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8n't no one can say I'm not willing to meet people half way!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Whew........</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I'm losing a lot of 8lood here.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Good thing I seem to have a ton of the stuff. We high8loods are made of some pretty tough shit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: What a fucking mess, though. Not really looking forward to cleaning this up.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I've got to say, your prank was pretty good. Still not sure how you pulled it off. Pretty inconvenient though!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: It's too 8ad you're not going to get to read this for a while, if ever. We could 8e 8onding over the gr8 pranks we just pulled on each other!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Oh well.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Guess I'll take off. 8efore I drop dead like some kind of loser and you never get to hear from me again.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: See you around, sis.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">GC: WOW</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">GC: 1 C4NT B3L13V3 1 4LMOST FORGOT</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">GC: WH4T 4 COMPL3T3LY CR4ZY B1TCH YOU W3R3</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Hey now!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: What kind of attitude is that to 8ring into this memory?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">GC: OH</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">GC: Y34H</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">GC: SORRY &gt;:[</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Easy, there.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: No need to waste good remorse on such a trivial exchange.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I am only reminding you,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: That if you 8ring too much 8aggage from the past into the memory, it is dou8tful your experience will 8e either therapeutic or cathartic.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">GC: UH</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">GC: WH4T</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: You were the one who invoked this memory after all.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Isn't this why you are here?
