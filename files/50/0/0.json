It doesn't matter that it's April and not terribly chilly outside. In a home, a FIREPLACE needs a fire, because that's what FIREPLACE is for. A fire BELONGS in a FIREPLACE, dammit, cata(ptcha)gorically, at all times, without exception.\r<br/> <br/>As domestic myth of unaccountable origin holds, a home borrows the spirit of the flame for as long as it makes a guest of it, much as the moon takes liberty with the sun's rays.\r<br/> <br/>\"The moon's an arrant thief, and her pale fire she snatches from the sun.\"  -Mark Twain\r<br/> <br/>You are almost certain Mark Twain said that.</p>",
