Concepts like \"now\" and \"how long\" are figures of speech used to make communication simpler.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I've quit trying to give expression to the elusive temporal properties of this place. It's easier staying conversational.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ut I will say that 8eing here \"for so long\" lends itself to a certain detachment from what you see. Otherwise, monitoring the atrocities stemming from our failure wouldn't 8e much fun.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">GC: DO YOU M1SS YOUR WORLD 4S MUCH 4S 1 DO?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yes, sometimes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ut missing it usually invites memories of home to serve as the stage.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Not that it's a su8stitute for the previous reality. 8ut the reminders of home are everywhere.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">GC: WH4T 4BOUT YOUR FR13NDS? 1 GU3SS YOU ST1LL G3T TO H4NG OUT W1TH TH3M 4LL?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yes. I see them often enough.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Except for one, whom I haven't seen at all since 8efore we all died.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: In fact, she's the only reason we are here in the first place, as opposed to merely ceasing to exist upon the scratch.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: In life, she was the only one I would have called a close friend, in a way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: The thing is, no8ody liked her much either. We had that in common. ::::)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">GC: WOW, 1TS B33N TH4T LONG S1NC3 YOU S4W H3R?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Remem8er how I said the gods could keep you dancing around someone you're looking for indefinitely?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">GC: Y34H BUT...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">GC: B1LL1ONS OF SW33PS??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Well, \"8illions,\" yes. In a manner of speaking.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">GC: 1S SH3 BY 4NY CH4NC3 TH3 TROUBL3M4K3R YOU W3R3 T4LK1NG 4BOUT?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: That's right.

That one never 8elonged to my world. It is your memory, not mine.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">GC: Y34H TH3 CUT3 L1TTL3 BUBBL3GUM MOONS! TH4TS WH3R3 SH3 1S?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: It's the setting of the memory she entered.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: From her perspective, she has just arrived here.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Your friends should 8e joining us too, 8efore your meteor clears the 8u88le.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: May8e together we can 8ring the Thief of Life up to speed.</p>",
