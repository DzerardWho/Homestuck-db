Musty attics. Huge spiders. Did I mention the spiders? Let me tell you, I got HELLA spiders up in this...\r<br/> <br/>Fuck, this horn fell off. Dammit. Piece of shit. Wonder if there's any glue in here... oh screw it.\r<br/> <br/>Do you have any idea how much power I wield over you?? To what extent I can RUIN the shit you step in with that squeaky clean sunday loafer you use to stomp that bookmark and stamp that F5 key, day goddamn in and day fucking out??? Do you possess even the most infinitesimal kernel of cognizance for the degree to which I can make the shorn, shivering weasel that is the totem spirit representing your wretched fascination with this website squeal in heartrending remorse????\r<br/> <br/>It would be so easy! I could snap my gray smudgy fingers RIGHT NOW, and make you read all the troll romance exposition segments all over again, BACK TO BACK TO BACK TO BACK TO BACK TO BACK.\r<br/> <br/>Oh, you don't think I'll do it????????</p>",
