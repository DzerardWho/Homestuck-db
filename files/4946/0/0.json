Taking on these wild appearance modifications just for a little boost in power always struck you as tacky. Where's the class?\r<br/> <br/>It just takes no creativity or guile for these villain types to grab a little power through such outlandish transformations. No imagination at all. You are utterly astounded by how shitty their imagination is. If their imagination was a face you would shoot it.\r<br/> <br/>In the face. </p>",
