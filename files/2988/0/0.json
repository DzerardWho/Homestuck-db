Its hearth was quelled, and as it cooled so swooned the verdancy it kept above. In slumber it grew a thick winter skin, white as bedsheets. In their folds the waker dreamt, her breath as steam, her touch as hot as iron, forgotten in the fire.\r<br/> <br/>Oh, that this too too solid flesh would melt, thaw and resolve itself into a dew!\"\r<br/> <br/>-Acclaimed actor and sleeping prophet, Charles Dutton</p>",
