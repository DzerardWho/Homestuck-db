Mostly For Me</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Actually You Know What</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Im Not Really Feeling This At All</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Goodbye</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: she's not here right now, she's asleep!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: but ok, see you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Is This</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Your Human Sarcasm That Ive Heard About</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: That You Always Use</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: And That Is Basically A Terrible Way To Communicate</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: umm... no?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Thought That Was The Thing You Did</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: The Rose Human Specifically</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: oh, yeah.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: that's me! i am the rose human. look at me, i am so smart with all these snooty words and complicated things to say.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: i am the queen of books.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Okay These Are Definitely Insincere Statements</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Why Do You Work So Hard At Being So Awful</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: fffuuhhhhhhhh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: i'm so burned, these burns are crazy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: can we just cut to the chase and be friends already??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: these cat and mouse games are so dumb, you know we're just going to all be friends at some point anyway.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Have We Spoken Before</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: i don't know, uh, maybe???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: it's hard to keep track with all your time nonsense.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Now That I Think About It It Is Pretty Conceivable That I Will Talk To You Again In The Past After This Conversation</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: that's because you guys always do things the hard way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: and the dumb way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Should Figure Out How The Viewport Feature Of This Application Works</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: So I Can See What Such A Primitive Creature Looks Like</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: haha, well i know what you guys look like.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: you look kind of like...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: howie mandel from little monsters.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: even though, to be perfectly frank, he was kind of a big monster.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: because he was a big goofy adult.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: and fred savage was like his child prankster sidekick.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Is This An Adversary You Have Encountered On Your Quest</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: no, it's a movie.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: you should ask john about it, because he thinks it's awesome, which it is.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: It Seems You Put Stock In Johns Assessment Of Things</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Even Really Uninteresting Things That Are Pretty Terrible To Listen To</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: He Is Either The Leader Of Your Party Or You Hold Whatever The Human Equivalent Of Mating Fondness For Him Is</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: yeah, i got him this really cool bunny for his birthday, and it's really nicely knitted and everything.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: because i am basically in love with him, you are right.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Uh Okay</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: heh, just kidding. i'm sure john knows it's cause i am really thoughtful and i bet he really appreciates the present, and would say thank you if he were here!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Okay Human Courtship Is Definitely A Strange Thing And Its Sort Of Blowing My Mind Listening To This</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Think Ill Talk To Someone Else Now</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: why don't you talk to john?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Maybe</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: When Along His Timeline Would You Recommend Communicating With Him</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: oh man, i don't know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: why don't you pick the time that will make the most complicated mess out of everything imaginable?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: you know that's what you're gonna do anyway.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Considering That Youre Obviously Not That Smart</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: And Basically Understand Whipping Bugwinged Fuckall About Even The Most Elementary Temporal Mechanics</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Am A Bit Perplexed As To Why I Find Myself So Vehemently Fondling The Short End Of The Antagonism Stick Here</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Kind Of Irritating</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Im Going To Talk To Your Comrades</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: This John Human</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: And Figure Out Whats Going On</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: if you talk to him in the past...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: he'll understand even less buggywhipped fuckall about time, and he'll be confused.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: so maybe paste something from this conversation to him? i don't know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: and if you talk to him in the future...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: he'll probably know all this stuff, like things you've said to him but haven't said yet!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: and then you'll be confused.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: sorry, that's just how this works.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: don't say i didn't warn you!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Consider Me Fully Briefed On The Matter.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Until Next Time Rose</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Next Time In The Past</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: yeah, bye!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: (heheheheheheh)</p>\n\n-- grimAuxiliatrix <span style=\"color: #008141\">[GA]</span> ceased trolling
