I haven't seen him in a while.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ut we are not under attack.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Not yet, at least.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: oh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: well, then...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: who did you kill?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: He was a friend.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Someone from our team.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: why?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: It's a little complicated.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: well, did he attack you or something?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ut really, that's not why I killed him. He was no match for me, and I could have just incapacit8ed him or flown away or whatever.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: The truth is I killed him 8ecause at the time, I thought I wanted to, and sort of felt like I finally had to.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: uh...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: why did you have to?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ecause enough was enough! You don't even know how frustr8ing it was to 8e friends with him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I used to really like him and always wanted to help him get stronger, so that he might stand a fucking chance to actually make it on our world.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ut he was just soooooooo weak and indecisive. He wouldn't change!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: And when he tried to change, it was too little and too l8. Always l8. L8ey L8ey L88888888.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Too l8 to kiss me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Too l8 to kill me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: He couldn't do it when I really needed him to. So when I saw he was actually serious a8out trying to kill me now of all times...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I just got SO AAAAAAAANGRY. I am still a 8it upset thinking a8out it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: So I killed him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: And I'm pretty sure he's dead for good now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: wow.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: you're right, vriska. that does not sound good.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I know!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I know our races are completely different. And I really h8 the idea of you thinking worse of me 8ecause of this.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ut I don't have anyone else to talk to a8out it!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: you don't?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: what about all of your friends?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i bet karkat would listen.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: or what about terezi? she's pretty nice, isn't she?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: No no no no no no no no!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I mean, yeah, they're fine. 8ut I can't talk to them!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: why not?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: For one thing, they would pro8a8ly just 8e pissed off at me for killing Tavros.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: And more importantly, there's no waaaaaaaay I could tell them how I really feel a8out it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: well, how do you feel?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Horri8le!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: If any of my friends knew that, they would think I'm weak.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: oh...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i guess i understand. i mean, i'm trying to, with the cultural difference and all.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Do you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: like, trolls are more violent and angry, right? kind of like klingons or something, which is an angry race of alien savages from a human tv show.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: We aren't savages, you dope!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: oh, i know, that's not what i meant! but i am guessing you all have to act tough to make it in your world, and have a sense of honor about fighting, and like to beat people up and stuff, right?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Uh, yeah........</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Let's say close enough!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: but i think that no matter what alien culture you are from, killing is still wrong!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: and it sounds like you do too.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yeah, see.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: This is where our cultures clash, I think.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: It would 8e difficult to explain exactly how killing is viewed on our planet with all the nuance involved.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: It just isn't the 8lack and white thing humans seem to think it is!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: well, you could try. i am listening.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: On my world, I would 8e completely vindic8ed for killing him! He is far lower on the hemospectrum than me. He managed to disrespect me time and time again, 8ut I kept letting him live! In fact, the amount of slack I cut him would 8e considered scandalous 8y those in my class.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I had every reason to kill him. And yet...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I feel 8ad a8out it like a lame weak fudge8lood, just like he was.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: And the fact that I feel 8ad is why I'm sort of freaking out right now!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i think if you feel bad, it just means you have a conscience. which is good, right?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: No. That's not how it works.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I'm supposed to 8e just fine with it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: This was sort of like a test, and I'm afraid I might 8e failing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: how was it like a test?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Well, it was the first time I killed some8ody.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: W8! Ok, that's not really true. What I meant was, it was the first time I killed some8ody I cared a8out.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: so...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: you killed other people, that you didn't care about?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yes. Sort of a lot, actually. 8ut there was a really good reason for that!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: hm. how many?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: or... do i want to know...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Oh, it doesn't matter. Pro8a8ly many thousands.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: uhhhhhhhh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: hopy shit...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: God, I know how this sounds! 8ut I had to feed her. My lusus I mean. I've 8asically 8een playing this role as a slave in the food chain my whole life. It is what she selected me to do.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i guess that is why you didn't get along with her?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Hell yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i see.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: still, that is a LOT of killing. jesus...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yeah, 8ut I never felt anything a8out it. It was just normal life for me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: but then you finally killed a guy you liked, and...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: not so cool anymore?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yeah. OH!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Ok, that's not quite right. He's the second person I cared a8out who I killed.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Man, I always forget a8out her!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: uh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I guess she wound up getting me 8ack pretty good though, so we're even.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Oh, also, TECHNICALLY I attempted to kill that same guy around the same time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ut I just wound up paralyzing him! Oops, hahahaha.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: ...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ut man. That was sweeps ago.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I think I had a really juvenile attitude a8out killing 8ack then. I think I was trying too hard?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I was always really o8sessed with 8eing the 8est at stuff, and I guess I was trying to 8e precocious in that respect as well, and prove to everyone how 8rutal I could be.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ut I was such a confused kid! I didn't know anything a8out what killing really means. I was trying to fake it, and it caused me nothing 8ut pro8lems.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i guess i had no idea how different we really were.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: what i am hearing is seriously scaring the shit out of me!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yeah, I know. I wish we didn't have to 8e so different. I'm just trying to 8e honest with you, 8ecause like I said, I have nowhere else to go.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: ok, well i appreciate the honesty.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: so... if killing isn't exactly wrong, then what is it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: what do you mean by \"what killing really means\"?</p>",
