The one she will hold guilty until proven otherwise, a process customarily taking place after the execution.\r<br/> <br/>Even so, it is only prudent to stay open to the possibility of other culprits. As they say in your line of work, there's always room on the gallows for more to swing. And though executing the wrong person is only a minor embarrassment to the courtblock, it is an embarrassment nonetheless. \r<br/> <br/>His Tyranny will surely commend you for your due diligence by graciously neglecting to eat you after the trial.</p>",
