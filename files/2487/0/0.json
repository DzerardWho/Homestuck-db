I was chased by some bullies into this fucking attic and now I am watching people watching people watching more people kissing and stuff basically forever. How many metalayers removed this story can we get?? \r<br/> <br/>This attic is spooky. I wish those bullies would just leave me alone.\r<br/> <br/>Later I am going to ride a long magic dog through the sky and fuck their shit up.</p>",
