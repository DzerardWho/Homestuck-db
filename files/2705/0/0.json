you are a time traveling space alien from the future, sent here to study humans?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: No</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: are you from mars? is it a mission of peace?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: No John You Werent Listening</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: what does your time machine look like? a phone booth? phone booths are a popular thing for some reason.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Damn It</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: were you lured to earth by a huge gyroscopey thing that jodie foster piloted in contact, while matthew mcconaughey sort of acted as her spiritual guide i guess...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: What The Hell</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: and then he kind of preached to her about having faith instead of believing in the sciences so hard all the time, and i guess in the end she believed him, maybe?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: actually, im not even sure what the point of mcconaughey was in that movie. but he was still awesome.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: and then jodie found her dad on an alien planet... but i think he was a ghost or something? or maybe an alien in disguise.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: and then she went home and nobody believed her, but you just KNOW mcconaughey believed her.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: because he had all the faith. and i mean ALL OF IT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: anyway, does that have any applicability to your cosmic interstellar astrojourney?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Okay

If You Werent So Stupid Id Suspect You Were Being Insincere For The Benefit Of Your Amusement</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: ha ha ha. i don't follow!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: I Just Spoke To Her In The Future</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Shes An Imbecile And Conveying How Much I Dislike Her At This Point Presents An Overwhelming Gauntlet Of Personal Expression</p>\n<p

was kind of a big monster. </p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: TT: because he was a big goofy adult. </p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: TT: and fred savage was like his child prankster sidekick.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: GA: Is This An Adversary You Have Encountered On Your Quest </p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: TT: no, it's a movie. </p>\n<p style=\"color:

#008141\">GA: That It Was A Charade Meant To Make Me Look Foolish</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: possibly! i know that sure didn't sound like her.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: but i think it's more likely that you made it all up cause you know i like that movie.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: so i tip my cap to you, well played miss troll!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008141\">GA: Now Im Wondering If You Might Be Trolling Me As Well</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: ok well, just between you and me...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: SOMEONE here is getting

#0715cd\">GT: listen, i'm kind of busy, i have to wrap this present and mail it in a hurry.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: so i'm going to block you!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">GT: but i
