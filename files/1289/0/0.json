It's a bloody mess in here. The clocks are more bullet-riddled than ever. And it seems <span style=\"color: #2ed73a\">Crowbar</span> and both <span style=\"color: #2ed73a\">Sawbucks</span> have been decapitated. You're almost certain this is something you will be, or were already, responsible for. Which of course means more time traveling.\r<br/> <br/>Looks like the tub and chest are gone. Which means future-you must have packed up and left already. Got to take note of these sorts of things so you know where you are in the timeline.\r<br/> <br/>You notice something on the wall over there...</p>",
