Fittingly, a void player to lead a void session.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: She would be a leader not in name or in spirit or in function, whatever that means.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: But more of an emotional leader, who would selflessly try to hold everyone together while the rest of us did our best to fall apart.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: And Roxy has been that for us every step of the way, going unnoticed and unappreciated.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Think of how much shit she's had to put up with from all of us.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: She never complains, never turns it around and makes it about her problems.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: She just works her ass off making sure we all stay friends.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: If that isn't a leader, I don't know what is.</p>",
