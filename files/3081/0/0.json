Pretty exciting, isn't it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: yeah...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: maybe it is a little TOO exciting.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: What's that mean?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i am not sleepy at all!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: also, this is not much of a bed. more like a really hard slab of rock.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i don't see how i will be able to sleep.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: John.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Would you like me to put you to sleep?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: um...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: you mean, you're asking me this time, instead of just doing it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: what happened to you wanting to be responsible for me becoming a hero!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: John, I am clearly involved in your rise to power now regardless. That can't 8e changed!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I am giving you the option, 8ecause at some point a hero has to start making choices.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Once you take a 8r8k from hunting treasure and stop getting distracted 8y side quests, you eventually realize that's what this game is all a8out.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: The choices you make affect the destiny of the universe you cre8te, as well as the type of hero you 8ecome.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: It would have 8een nice if someone was around to explain all this to me, and let me have some control over my own f8.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I had to do this a much less pleasant way. I'm sparing you that indignity.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8esides, it's not like you're some loser who doesn't know how to make tough decisions.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: So what'll it 8e, John?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: well...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i'm supposed to go to sleep to realize my destiny...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: and you have the ability to make me do that, so...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i don't really see the harm in that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: it sounds like it is just the practical thing to do.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Am I hearing a \"yes,\" John?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: yes, that is my decision.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: vriska, please put me to sleep!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: You got it. &lt;3</p>",
