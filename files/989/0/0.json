This time you didn't foolishly destroy any items. You just looked at the codes for some objects you rounded up, and punched them on blank cards.\r<br/> <br/>You wonder how much alchemizing you can get away with before Rose gets back? As if she's got any right to tell you what to do with your hard earned grist. You're the one running around here putting your ass on the line. All she's got to do is mess around with her computer!\r<br/> <br/>Anyway, you better hurry.</p>",
