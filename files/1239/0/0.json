Might as well keep track of everyone you've offed this way too.\r<br/> <br/>Not that you intend to abuse its power to settle your score. What's the point if you're not gonna get your hands dirty.\r<br/> <br/>Still, it might come in handy down the road. <span style=\"color: #2ed73a\">Lord English</span> is supposedly indestructible. He's rumored to be killable only through a number of glitches and exploits in spacetime. The doll may ultimately help you work the system if it comes to that.</p>",
