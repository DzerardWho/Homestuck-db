Just making sure!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Jake was having some issues with it earlier, and I don't think he received its obfuscating tendencies in the humorous spirit intended.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Yes, I'm catching up with the situation now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Oh, so you're talking to Jake then?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Nah. Just reading their chat logs.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Man, what the fuck?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I can't leave these two alone for a minute. Can a guy get his ablutions on in fucking peace?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: :B</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Was it that bad?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Not really.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: The responder doesn't much distort my position on things usually.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Its demeanor leaves something desired though. I'd prefer it didn't make such aggressive and repeated claims of fidelity to my persona.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Be misrepresentin' hells of key subtleties, yo.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Why not just turn it off then?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Keeps them both on their toes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Who?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Jake and the responder.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Jake needs to be more skeptical. Rather than take a Pollyanna jackknife ass-first off whatever turnip truck is blowing through town that day, he's got to apply more critical reasoning to shit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I keep telling him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I keep telling him, dude, you got to be more like Jane.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: These lectures I presume are roughly similar in complexion to those I'm familiar with?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Those wherein I have, and I quote, \"got to be more like Jake?\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Yes, exactly.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You're finally fucking getting it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I sincerely doubt that I am!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Said the stubborn skeptic, skeptically.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Let's not talk about my \"issues\" again, shalln't we?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Shalln't?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: That ain't a thing to say, even for you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Shush!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: The word shalln't escape my vocabulary any longer, just as you SHALLN'T nitpick my language! That's my turf you're on, buster.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Alright. Kinda don't care.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: What were you saying?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: About what? Jake?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: About leaving the responder on!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Yeah.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Anyway, I kind of owe it to him to let the program run as often as possible.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Jake?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: No.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: The responder.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It is a fully cognitive, self-aware entity I am responsible for, not even to mention an approximate cerebral duplicate of myself.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: You don't just make a clone of yourself to live in a dead end existence where it has no chance to thrive as an individual or surpass its limitations.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: That'd be sick.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: True.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Also.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: The more the software runs, the broader and more detailed its experiential canopy becomes. Makes for a better dialogic partner.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Dialogic?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Are you saying you have conversations with your own auto-responder?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Of course.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Why do you think I made the thing?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Hrm, that's interesting.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I guess I always thought it was just a really elaborate gag!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It's that too.</p>",
