HAHAHA! now that i think about it, i fucking LOVE malloy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i'm going to rewind it to watch that scene again...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: no!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: dont touch the remote</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: oh, and we're supposed to be like \"YEAH\" when cusack wrecks malloy's awesome sports car.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but that was a nice car! john cusack shouldn't have ruined it like that for laughs.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i know *I* wasn't laughing, were you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: YES :p</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: john cusack was such a terrible character in this movie now that i think about it. i don't really get what he added to it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: he was like the second hero... but dorkier? what did he even really do? he scampered around the junkyard for a while goofing off, and then when it was his time to shine...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: HE DEMONSTRATED HIS MASTERY OVER HEAVY MACHINERY! wow, he can operate a crane! i am thrilled by the exploits of this pedantic weenie.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i guess he's actually like cage's estranged sidekick? almost like the robin that batman never realized he had.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: now that i think about it, this movie was always an oddly poignant tale of bromance between cage and cusack. just two bros separated by destiny, waiting to be united.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: when they finally come together to kick some ass, it is arguably more moving than when he reunites with his wife and daughter!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i wonder if i'll think that scene sucks now too? it used to move me to tears, but now i'll probably think it's so lame, i'm almost afraid to watch it. maybe i should try to leave at least SOME memories untainted.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: john you are kind of sounding like a crazy person here</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: yeah right! crazy like a fOWWW!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE: what???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: oh...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i guess there was a stray feather clinging to my pajamas and it just poked me in the ass.</p>",
