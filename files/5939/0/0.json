It's like you can't get enough of me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I think you might be obsessed.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">GIVE ME MORE HOT TIPS ASSHOLE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You only made that caltop so you could talk to me on the go, didn't you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Please, don't lie. Who else would you use it to talk to in your solo session? GAMZEE?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I bet you haven't said one word to him through that device. You never even refer to him by his name.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THE CLOWN HAS BEEN AN ADEQUATE PEON. WHEN IT COMES TO DOING THINGS I DON'T WANT TO DO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THERE IS NO REASON TO SPEAK TO HIM THROUGH MY FUN HELMET.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You should try to be better friends with him. </p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">He basically ditched his best buddy for you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHO CARES?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">He reveres you, and you treat him like shit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YES.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">SO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">So...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You're off to a pretty good start at being a god, I guess?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THANK YOU.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">LOOK. I JUST SAID A POLITE THING.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NOW REWARD ME WITH WHAT I WANT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Ugh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YELLOW HAT IS VERY FAST.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">AS A MINION HE HAS BEEN VERY USEFUL.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">BUT I AM HAVING TROUBLE DETERMINING THE ABILITIES OF BLUE HAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yellow hat and blue hat?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You should come up with better names for them than that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">LIKE WHAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Like, I don't know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Maybe some cool mobster names?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">MOBSTER NAMES.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHY WOULD I GIVE THEM MOBSTER NAMES.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Because mobsters are cool.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE MOBSTERS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THEY LOOK LIKE FUCKING LEPRECHAUNS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Anyone can be a mobster though. Even cherubs and leprechauns.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Being a mobster isn't about what you look like, it's about what's inside you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WOW. THAT IS SO PROFOUND.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NOW STOP STALLING AND GIVE ME TIPS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Are these the only two you've unlocked so far?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YES.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I HAVE CONQUERED THE SECOND PLANET.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">AND HAVE NOW TRAVELED TO THE THIRD.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">BEFORE I CONQUER THIS ONE. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT BLUE HAT DOES.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">He's pretty much doing what he does.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">HE SEEMS TO BE STUCK.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">IS HE BROKEN.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">No. He's just slow.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">That's his power.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yellow hat is fast.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Blue hat is slow.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THAT'S A HORRIBLE POWER.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">HOW IS THAT EVEN A POWER.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">It just is.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">ARGH.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO ACHIEVING MORE POWERFUL MINIONS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NOT MORE MALINGERING FOOLS TO TAKE UP SPACE IN MY DARK CARNIVAL.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">DO THEY GET BETTER THAN THIS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">That depends on what you mean by better.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">OH MY GOD.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">OK.
