mega man style power boosts and all</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: what about yours</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: howd that go</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: how'd it go?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: pretty well, i'd say.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: no but</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: i know you blew away some clouds and blanked out the sky and all</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: but the point was so you could learn to control your zappy powers</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: did you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i think so.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but i haven't really tried a controlled jump yet.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: i c</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: well when you do</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: where do you think youll jump to first</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i have no idea.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: the thought of changing the time line is still mind boggling to me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: well if nothin else</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: u really should go grab that ring</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: before the smug troll can take it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: i mean there was lots of problems already but her comin back to life really fucked us over to the shittiest max possible</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: that's right!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i definitely wanted to go back and get the ring off my couch before i lost it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: at the very least, that way you can use it to help your friend.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: yup!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: any other ideas?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: not yet.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: so much has happened, it's hard to even think about.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: and it's not even limited to what i've been through, either.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i've seen a lot of other crazy stuff, just from my random jumps.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: like what</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: like...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: like the last place i was, actually.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: just before i came back, to find your session in ruins.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: haha. i actually got into a pretty serious fight.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: o?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: with this guy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: a skull kid.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: he's a huge asshole, and a horrible artist.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: u saw the skull kids drawins?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: unfortunately.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: in fact, i was in his drawings once.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: it was a true nightmare come to life.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: D:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i am pretty much convinced he is the guy behind all of the problems we ever had, even though he is a complete ignoramus.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: then you mean</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: it was callies bro</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: yeah, probably.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i have a feeling some day we will all have to take him down.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: probably when he grows up to be his adult self.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: when i beat him up, he was just a teen scamp, like us.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but with a skull for a head, a robot leg, a cape which i ripped to shreds, and a pair of dumb suspenders.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: you beat him up????</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: daaamn</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: yall must be STRONG</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: meh, not particularly.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i was just really angry, and i caught him off guard drawing some shitty animes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: ahahahahaha</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: fuck his animes</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: they were quite literally the worst animes i have ever seen.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i hope i hurt his drawing hand, and he never does any more ugly art for the rest of his stupid immortal skull monster life.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: yeah</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: i know that guy</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: he used to troll my friends all the time</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: wait no</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: used to \"jeer\" us</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ff6ff2\">ROXY: he was a tool</p>",
