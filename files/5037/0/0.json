There is a new unaccounted for variable.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Particularly for Roxy and Dirk.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: What is it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: They are probably going to die if they don't join the game very soon.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Shucks!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Hey, I'm upset about it too, but let's watch the fucking language.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Ok, what do I do?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Install the server. I downloaded it to your computer along with a few other crucial system upgrades when we established our connection.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Upgrades? What upgrades?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Wait, is that how this stupid \"Delirious Biznasty\" application got on here?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: No comment.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Install and run the server.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: You will be connecting with Roxy. I will have Jake connect with Dirk. Setting up the chain like this will be important.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Why?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: It seems that I again have no comment.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Sheesh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Very well then, Mister Zipperlips.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: I don't have lips. You just said something laughably illogical.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: How typical of someone who isn't a fashion accessory of immeasurable intelligence.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Whatever! Let's curtail the horseplay this once while I help Roxy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Ok. I installed it. Now what? Should I run it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TT: Yes. That copy is programmed to connect automatically with the client she's running.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Okey dokey. Doing that now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Hey, I can see her room! :B</p>",
