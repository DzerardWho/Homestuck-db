She didn't have to.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I should have just told every8ody that. I guess I wanted to 8elieve it too. Like we were equal partners in crime. Ancestor and descendant united at last, and working gr8 together.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I hope you don't think that makes me a huge phony.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: why would i give a fish about that</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Yeah.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: You're right, you wouldn't.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I shouldn't 8e saying needy shit like that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I'm just a 8it depressed, 8ecause it feels like I'm running out of friends all over again.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: i hear you</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: she ditched me too</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: cant blame her i guess</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: what can i say girl loves her piratesona</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: she wanna be dat pirate chick so bad</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: who am i to fault ambition</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: she cast her lure into the lake of cute but dumbass dreams</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: i think her mindfang ideal is ridic to be lochness with you</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: that journal man</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: tales from the pirate who wont shut up</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: but then</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: im not one to talk about hero worship</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: i think my adult self happens to be the best best greatest most perfect beautiful woman -----EV-----ER an if you axed me if i wanted a crack at her job id be like glub yes put me down for T)(AT</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: so i legit hope it works out for her</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: but yeah</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: that dont mean i didnt get ditched</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: and that just</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: 38(</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: makes me reel sad</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Same.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: you sure we cant salvage the plan without her</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I don't know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Possi8ly?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: The way I was picturing it, a major feature of the original three pronged approach was to use the army to lead a first wave assault against him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Then while he was preoccupied 8y all those ghosts swamping him, I would go in for the kill with the secret weapon.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: So without an army, I guess we'd need to get close enough to him to use it 8efore he killed us.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: like uh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: sneak up on him?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I guess.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: 8ut I get the feeling Lord English is not the kind of guy you can just sneak up on.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: kay what if</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: i found some way to teleport over to him</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: and i beat the shit out of him with my wrestling moves</p>\n<p style=\"color: #77003c\">MEENAH: then you bust out the weapon</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Hahahaha.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: That would 8e awesome, if somewhat implausi8le.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: I guess we can think it over.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: 8ut if we're getting real here, this has all made me feel pretty lukewarm on the plan.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">VRISKA: Aranea checking the fuck out.
