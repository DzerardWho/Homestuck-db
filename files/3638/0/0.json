But he went to look for his father.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It would have been normal of me. I can't remember what I was trying to prove anymore.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i dont think you should be so hard on yourself about it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: john was being john, and you were being you, which i guess meant taking our problems very seriously and putting all your attention on solving them!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: and anyway, you and your mom had a much trickier relationship than john and his dad didnt you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i mean, not that i am saying that means you were any less attached to her than him...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: argh, i dont know if im very good at consoling people. sorry rose i dont want to make you feel worse :(</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: You're doing fine.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: For someone raised by a dog.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Or really,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Anyone.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Thanks.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: whew, ok</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: you know...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: now we have all lost guardians</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: dave lost his, and i lost mine in a weird way... uuum even though that was pretty much definitely my fault :\\</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: and even the trolls all lost their monster guardians</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i think that maybe it is an inevitable part of a game that can be cruel sometimes</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: For some reason, despite all the danger, I never thought she was in any trouble.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I never believed she would actually die.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I grew up with the feeling that something more significant had always been meant for her.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: That she was a heroine displaced in some way, resigned to the inglorious duty of raising me, and preparing me in her way.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I didn't actually need the ectobiological verification that she was like a mother and a sister at the same time. I always understood that somehow.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: And I felt she had knowledge and ability beyond what she let on. It was always intimidating, but nonetheless a source of respect which was childishly begrudging on my part.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I think she was just waiting for me to catch up with her.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: But now I can't.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: ......</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i am so sad</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: rose i think you are being stronger about it than i am</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Probably because my emotions have now ceded to anger.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: This shouldn't have happened.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: oh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: well</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i just hope you arent thinking of doing something rash</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I already was.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I was going to go to sleep, fly to a sun bigger than our universe, drop a bomb in it, and kill myself.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: yeaaah...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: So if my course of action is to change on account of my mood, it can only become less impetuous, don't you think?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: errrr, i dont know?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: You never liked my plan very much anyway.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: wellllll</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: no!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: but i was trusting that you had thought it through and it was our best hope</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I'm not sure if I did.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Maybe it was a terrible plan.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I made it without a full understanding of the nature of the Scratch.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: hm</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: then what will you do?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I could stop being so cowardly, for once.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I could short circuit this endlessly expanding game of chess we're playing, just like Jack decided to do.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: what does that mean!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Maybe I will go kill Jack myself.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Right now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: oh no no no no no!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: rose that is a much much worse plan!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: he would probably kill you!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Probably.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: But the Scratch will wipe us out anyway, and reboot the conditions of our session.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I suddenly don't feel much like sneaking through the back door of the Furthest Ring for retribution by distant super nova.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i know what you mean, i was angry at jack and wanted to stop him too, but we have to think of a more sensible way to do it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Whether my existing plan was sensible or not,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I may have been allowing myself to be manipulated by an omniscient being regardless.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: what? who?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Hello ladies.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: aaaaaaa whaaaaat?????</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: This is a private conversation.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Private even to those who know it word for word already.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Proceed.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">I will be here.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Watching.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: rose who is this!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Ignore him.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i dont even know whats going on anymore</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">You were discussing Ms. Lalonde's intrepid new variation on suicide.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">As one with a passion for the subject, I'm intrigued.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Shh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Anyway, if it's true the gods have \"selected\" me for service, maybe the power they've given me will be sufficient.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Maybe they wanted me to kill him all along.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Hee hee.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: SHHHHHHHHHH!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: please dont rose, i know you are angry but you arent thinking straight</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: But I am.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I'm fully aware I'll probably die and fail. Scratch happens, we start fresh. No recollection, no problem.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: nooo :(</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Jade, as an ambassador of Skaia, maybe you'd be willing to talk some sense into your friend?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">You should understand she's been corrupted by various entities with some rather questionable motives.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: rose, maybe white text guy is right?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: the dark gods gave you all these powers, and seem to be helping us with dream bubbles and stuff...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: but what if they are not actually good?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: They are enormous, ugly, and live in darkness.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: That doesn't necessarily make them bad.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: no...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: but i still dont trust them!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">If only there were a way to make this determination with certainty.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Through a reliable source within reach, for instance, at this exact moment. Perhaps one that is spherical, and devastatingly handsome.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: whats this weirdo talking about!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: The cue ball.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: oh yeah</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i noticed you found it!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i was worried it had been destroyed when my room blew up</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: is he saying you can use it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Yes. And he is right.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: omg</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: does it work???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It advised me to talk to you just now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: So I guess so.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: then maybe you should try it!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Yes, Rose. Listen to Jade.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">She is far less manipulative than I.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: What are you suggesting I ask it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: well</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: since we dont know much about the gods...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: why dont you ask it about them?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: So, you're saying I should ask it if the gods are evil?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i guess that is a way to put it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Even though at this point neither of you is highlighting my text to read it, this idea gets my vote.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Go ahead.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Ask, Seer.</p>",
