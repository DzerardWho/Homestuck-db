Adios, sweet Toreadoormat. \r<br/> <br/>You succumb to emotion. Tears are in order, probably. You attempt a sniffle. A wobble of the lip, even.\r<br/> <br/>Alas, the tears will not come. Stupid lousy doomed Dave and your stupid lousy complicity in his death. Getting you all cried out like that.\r<br/> <br/>Oh well, whatever. There are more important things at hand to concern yourself with than the flow of teal ocular discharge. A crime has been committed. \r<br/> <br/>And where crime strikes, there is justice to be done.</p>",
