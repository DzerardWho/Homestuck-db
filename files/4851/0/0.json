Another thing I forgot to mention.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: There are a lot of these humanoid creatures with hard shells. Some black, some white.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: As humanity was dwindling due to an increasingly whimsical and psychopathic Condesce, she began introducing more of these Carapacians on to the scene.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Are they aliens too?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Uh...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Sort of. They are definitely from other planets, so, yeah. Really the deal with where they came from is a whole other story for another time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: But the bottom line is at some point, somehow, she started herding a bunch of them from their home worlds on to Earth and multiplying them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Something like a hundred years ago it became clear she favored these guys more than humans as her subjects.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: They're very loyal and seem genuinely dedicated to serving her. Must be what they were bred for. She still treats them like shit though, unsurprisingly.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: All these colonies started sprouting up. Like these modular cities floating on the water.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: It probably sounds cooler than it is. But they're basically slums. That's where they tend to live in large numbers.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Roxy lives in one of these colonies. It's about 2000 miles from where I am.</p>",
