You then combine it with the red frog thingy to show the complete SCARLET RIBBITAR.\r<br/> <br/>But there's no way you can afford to make that yet. It costs even more now. \r<br/> <br/>Maybe you'll stick to combining items around your house for now, rather than stuff from your future sylladex. It'll be less confusing that way, and probably less expensive.</p>",
