You suppose it could be poetic?\r<br/> <br/>No, instead you think it is just sad.\r<br/> <br/>You were very foolish to believe you could be a leader of men. Look at what bearing that flag has wrought.\r<br/> <br/>Perhaps one day you will find something new to bear. A burden befitting of the peasant you truly are.\r<br/> <br/>Oh my what's that shiny thing in the water.</p>",
