Just you, a sword, some bad guys... it's a lot simpler than having to answer for things you did.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: For the most part, I feel pretty bad about the role I played in my friends' lives.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Especially Jake.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: what happened there</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: I don't even know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: An unmitigated disaster for which I'm entirely to blame.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: It's not any one thing. I think I was just a completely toxic element in his life from day one.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: I don't know what he's doing now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: I wouldn't be surprised if he was trying to avoid me as much as possible.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: I'm sure that's for the best.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: I think I need to stay out of his business for a good while, so I don't risk poisoning another innocent kid's life.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Like I did with you, apparently.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yeah</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i mean</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: maybe its a little different cause relations between peers is a whole other thing</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: its tricky shit and youre both figuring stuff out on a relatively equal footing and youre both at the same point in your lives</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: its not like when one person is older and supposed to be a lot more...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: never mind this is a fucked up thing to think about</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but the bottom line is yeah laying low while you sort out your stuff cant hurt</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Right.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: The thing with that, with my adult self's...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Ways.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: The sad thing is,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: I can really see it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: How someone like me can go unchecked in life, and turn out to become a much worse person than I already am.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: I guess I'm just relieved I still have some time to make sure that doesn't happen.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: you dont actually seem like a bad person to me though</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: No?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: nah</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Why not?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: We did just meet, after all.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: because</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i dunno if truly bad people wrestle so much with whether theyre good or bad</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i think if i ever sensed my bro like</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: struggled at all with what he was doing or who he was</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: or showed any sort of doubt</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: that might have changed everything</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but there was never a crack in it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: or the slightest hint of introspection behind the aggressive cooldude facade</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: if there was i sure never noticed</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i mean personally</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i think about it all the time now</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: what it actually means to be good or bad</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: or if not something that starkly moral</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: at least just trying to examine the difference between being decent and being a douche</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: maybe its because of him i worry about that now</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but for me i think that internal struggle is kind of mild</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: for him...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: or you i mean</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: it sounds like some pretty dark shit</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: like grappling with...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: becoming evil vs simply trying not to</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: Yeah.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">DIRK: That's not too far off.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but the point is</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: even just talkin to you a little bit</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: its obvious youve been fighting with that</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: which means that you care enough to put in some effort</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i think that counts for something</p>",
