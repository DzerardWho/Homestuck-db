I am omniscient, extremely powerful, and very charming.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Well,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Two out of three isn't bad.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Can you use your limitless intelligence to figure out which ones I mean?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">That was clever.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">If I plead ignorance to the fact that you are denying my charisma, it invalidates my claim of omniscience.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">But if I must adhere to my all knowing status, it forces me to validate the unfortunate reality that you are feigning the opinion that my demeamor is unpalatable.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Not that it matters, because I have all three qualities and you know it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: This is stupid.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Could we get to the point?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Yes, I was about to say.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">We should hurry this along. My visitor is beginning to set things on fire.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: You have a visitor?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Who?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Some guy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">I was joking anyway. I am not in a hurry at all.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: You tell jokes?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Haa haa.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: So, your visitor isn't setting anything on fire then?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Oh, he most definitely is.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Hee hee.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I'm really not getting this joke.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">I was joking about being in a hurry.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">From my perspective, this conversation is taking place in less than one second.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">I type very quickly.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Hoo hoo.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I thought you didn't lie.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Aren't jokes essentially humorous lies?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: At least, those like the one you just attempted.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Jokes are only temporary lies.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">If the falsehood is never exposed, there is no punchline. If the punchline is never delivered, the lie is sealed forever, regardless of initial humorous intent. Lies are not funny.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I think if you're going to risk tarnishing your record of honesty, you should probably get better material.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">My joke was objectively funny. Who would know better than I?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: So you're saying an inaccurate statement doesn't count as a lie, as long as you say \"just kidding\" later?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Basically.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: What if it's much later? Is it still \"just a joke?\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">No, that would be something closer to a prank.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">I don't play pranks very often.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Are you allowed to lie about playing pranks? If I asked you if you were playing a prank on me, would you tell the truth?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">I am allowed to do whatever I want. I choose never to lie. I also choose to tell jokes now and then, and to play pranks quite sparingly.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">But I can say that I have never played a prank on you, and no statement I have made to you thus far, or will make in this conversation, will contain any trace of falsehood for the sake of setting up a joke or a prank, with the exception of the joke I just made, and another one I will make very soon.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I'm starting to change my mind.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Oh?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Yes. I think your joke was funny in retrospect. Actually, your whole shtick is pretty good. I'm warming up to it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Yes. I knew it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Just to be clear,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Was the assurance you just made a prank or a joke?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">It was neither. It was the truth.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Was that?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: The truth?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Ok.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Were you serious about wanting to die?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Why?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">I'll tell you later.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Why?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Because you asked.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: But why not now?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Because that piece of information would not fit elegantly into the sequence of our exchange at this moment.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Then you know how this entire conversation will go?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Is that true of all conversations you have?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Yes. Until, briefly, I don't. But the dark spots never last long. The truth disguises itself to me sometimes which can be mildly frustrating, but it usually reveals itself quickly, much as if a punchline was delivered. It's a humorous dialogue I have with reality, and it is very amusing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Then why do you bother with the conversations? Obligation to predestination, as usual?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">There is no obligation.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">It's a pleasure.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It is?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">I've always had a soft spot for young ladies.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Hmm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: That's a little creepy.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">No it's not.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Yes it is.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">No it's not.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It kind of is.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">I have looked into the future and determined that we would continue in this manner pointlessly for some time, so I am putting an end to it here.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: That doesn't make sense.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Was that the other joke?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Heh. Good one.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Thank you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: How young are the ladies you typically take a shining to?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: And does this mean you are attracted to me?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Suddenly this conversation is kind of terrible.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Of course I am not. Not in the way you mean.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">And anyway, you are applying standards of conduct frowned upon for your kind which make no sense to apply to me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">I am an immortal entity with a large cue ball for a head, and no biological means of reproduction.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: ...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Really.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Also, if you were millions of years old, you would find that nearly every lady you encounter is quite young, relatively speaking.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">There should be no reason for you to feel uncomfortable with this interaction. Try to think of me as one of your kindly human uncle figures.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">In fact, if I were in your presence now, I would offer you candy to prove it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Oh my god.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">What?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Can we talk about the scratch instead of this?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #ffffff\">Yes.</p>",
