Where would we all be without you?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: In a way you really have been the glue holding us all together on our adventure. Gosh youre a standup gal.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Oh which actually reminds me of ANOTHER thing thats been bugging me about dirk.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: He can often be almost hilariously self absorbed. Dont even get me started on when he starts going off on these long monologues about his philosophical gobbledygook.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I'm not sure he actually has much of a filter when it comes to what others regard as interesting points of conversation.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Not to rag on the guy too hard but i guess at times i would just like to see a little more self awareness from him is all.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Jake.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Did i tell you what happened on our last expedition together?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Jake.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: I cant remember if i mentioned. Oh man but thinking back on what happened its even more ridiculous in retrospect.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Where do i begin?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Jake!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: What?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Shut up!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Huh?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Shut up!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Errr.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Did i say something wrong?</p>",
