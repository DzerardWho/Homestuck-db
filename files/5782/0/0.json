I WANT TO KNOW HOW TO GET ON WITH THE REAL ADVENTURE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Has it occurred to you that your quest in its limitless tedium and thankless busywork was designed to facilitate your personal growth?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">To prepare you for your ultimate destiny beyond this game?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">ANYWAY DIDN'T YOU SAY ONE TIME. I WAS INCAPABLE OF GROWING???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Oh right.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Well, has it occurred to you that it might have been designed to fuck with your head and serve as a punishment for being such a horrible little shit?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YES!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YES.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THAT OCCURS TO ME. EVERY SECOND I THINK ABOUT IT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I HAVE TOLERATED MANY AGGRAVATIONS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">AND AM PREPARED TO TOLERATE MANY MORE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">IF IT GETS ME CLOSER TO TRIUMPHING OVER YOU AND THIS MORONIC GAME.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I WILL FIND MORE KEYS UNDER RANDOM ASS UNLABELED STONES.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I WILL WATCH ANOTHER MILLION HOURS OF NUMBSKULLS WHIMPERING ABOUT THEIR ROMANCE NOT COMING TRUE.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">I WILL EVEN ENDURE MORE OF THESE PATENTLY LUDICROUS ACT ACT ACT ACT ACT ACTS EVEN THOUGH THEY APPEAR TO MEAN NOTHING AT ALL.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">BUT WHAT I WILL NOT STAND FOR.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">IS GOING.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">FUCKING.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">BACKWARDS!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Fair enough.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">But I already told you how to accelerate your viewing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WHAT? WHEN.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">See those two panes of glass there?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Take your crowbar and smash them.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">OH. YEAH.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">UGH. I FORGOT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">IS THAT REALLY THE ONLY WAY. TO GO TO WHAT'S NEXT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">SO THAT I CAN PUT MY PLANS IN MOTION?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You should be pleased by the irony.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Smashing the glass will cause you to reflect upon a lifetime you have yet to spend...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Um.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Breaking stuff.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Is the irony not fucking delicious?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NO.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">STOP TRYING TO BOGART MY SCHTICK. OF PLAYING INSIDIOUS MIND GAMES AND DOING SHITTY TWISTS.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">YOU SUCK AT IT SO BAD.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">I'm sorry.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">IT'S NOT BREAKING THE GLASS I MIND.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THIS IS THE THING THAT INVOLVES.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">*SHUDDER*</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">\"TEAM WORK\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">RIGHT?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You and a buddy have to turn both keys simultaneously.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">It will teach you a wonderful lesson about life.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">FUCK!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Don't act like you aren't secretly having a great time there with your new friends.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">You are practically the ringmaster of your own little dark carnival by now.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">And you're loving every minute of it. Don't deny it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NO I'M NOT!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Sooner or later you will have to face the fact that literally all adventures are about learning the value of teamwork.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Teamwork and friendship. The two razor sharp edges of the mighty excalibur which EVERY hero should keep in his scabbard.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000\">Even shitty heroes like you.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">FINE. I'LL DO IT.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">BUT ONLY BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE. WHERE I TALK TO YOU. FOR EVEN ONE MORE SECOND.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WOULD BE SO MUCH WORSE.</p>\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/promptlock.gif\"/> <span style=\"color: #2ed73a\">-- The narrative prompt has been locked. --</span> </p>",
