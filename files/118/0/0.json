You can only use the item on the bottom card, and must wait for items on upper cards to be pushed back to it.\r<br/> <br/>For instance, the RED PACKAGE is now inaccessible. You can only use the RAZOR at the moment.\r<br/> <br/>This modus doesn't strike you as a significant upgrade to your previous one. In fact, it almost seems more inconvenient. You figure you might as well give it a chance though.</p>",
