You promised you'd build it for an especially powerful and influential member of the nautical aristocracy, in return for his collusion during your campaigns. Some guy you were in cahoots with! You guess none of it matter now though.\r<br/> <br/>It was tough to build, and isn't perfect yet. Luckily one of your pals nearby is pretty handy with technology. He can be tapped for parts and favors frequently.\r<br/> <br/>You wonder if any other kid on the planet has as many irons in the fire as you.\r<br/> <br/>YOU DOUBT IT.</p>",
