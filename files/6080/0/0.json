They lurch from the mounds to serve their dark master. You're so happy to see them. You start to blow some sinister friendship bubbles. \r<br/> <br/>You look at all these skeletons and think to yourself, this is probably going to be really important later on. Because that's what happens in adventures. A thing happens, then you forget about the thing for a while, but it turns out to be important down the road. Like some heroes will be fighting a bad guy, and things will look bleak for them. But then out of nowhere this skeleton army will arrive as reinforcements or something, thus turning the tide of battle. Then you go, ah-ha. So that's why that little salamander summoned those skeletons. Everything makes sense now, and in retrospect is elegant in its simplicity.\r<br/> <br/><img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/scorpio.gif\"/><span style=\"color: #005682\">FUCK YOU!!!!!!!!</span><img border=\"0\" src=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/scorpio.gif\"/> <br/> <br/>Please, don't interrupt. We are trying to enjoy an important subplot.\r<br/> <br/>Now where were we. Oh, look! One of the skeletons has stepped forward to introduce himself. But the skeleton doesn't have a name. You should give him one! What will you name the skeleton?\r<br/> <br/>&gt; Clattersworth\r<br/>&gt; Bonebone\r<br/>&gt; Captain Nibbles\r<br/>&gt; Fossilbee Oldington the Third\r<br/>&gt; Mr. Ribs\r<br/>&gt; Skulligan Malone</p>",
