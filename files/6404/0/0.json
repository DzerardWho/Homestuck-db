#0715cd\">JOHN: no, it's not time travel!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: well, not technically.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: who do you think youre talking to here</p>\n<p

#e00707\">DAVE: wow wait that was a terrible figure of speech in this context but you know what i mean</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yo like i was JUST saying i didnt want to time travel

what is it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i dunno!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: like, some kind of surreal, history altering... reality hopping... magic power.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: thats time travel genius</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: no way, dude.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: you have to trust me on this.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: alright</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but if it turns out you just created a doomed timeline and were all going to die im gonna be hella mad</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: this isn't a doomed timeline.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i'm telling you, i can change things.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: stuff that wasn't supposed to be changed.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: and i'm not saying bad stuff won't happen as a result of the things i change...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but at least it won't make a doomed timeline!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: the new things that happen will just be...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: the stuff that's supposed to happen?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: huh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: thats pretty dope if true</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: actually in a way that almost makes me more nervous</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: it does?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yeah messing with the alpha timeline</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i mean not the alpha timeline but the ALPHA alpha timeline</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: almost seems</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: heretical i guess?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: you sure you know what youre doing egbert</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: um, earth to dave.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i already said i don't have a clue what i'm doing!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: gotcha</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: welp im sold</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but uh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: really man you kind of are interrupting a thing</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: temporal mechanics not even withstanding</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: what was i interrupting?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i think this was going to be a serious conversation here</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i have a feeling jade and i were going to get all heavy with our relationship issues or whatever</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: you were?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">sigh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">yes, unfortunately thats probably where this was going</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: aw man, i'm sorry. i am fucking this up so bad.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: see, this is what i'm worried about.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: even though my random jumps are supposed to be a \"safe\" form of time travel, i'm still nervous that i might be ruining important events anyway.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: like, there was all this crazy stuff that happened to get us here, whether it was good or bad.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: and if i fumble around like this accidentally changing all that stuff, then i won't even know what's going on anymore.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: maybe no one will!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: uh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: does anyone even know whats going on NOW?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: that's what i'm saying!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: things are complicated enough as it is!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: truth</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: ok, look...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: maybe we can try to minimize my impact on the current situation.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: if i fly away, do you think you can do whatever you were going to do in the first place?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: do you know what you were going to do?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">yes</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">i was going to kick the mayor into the lava</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: what??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: holy shit so uncool</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">i was going to make it clear i was serious about killing someone you cared about</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">so you would stop being a baby and start using your powers and swordfight with me you dumb jerk :p</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: wow</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: jade i think you might be a little too good at being a villain its kind of worrying</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">thank you :)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: so the mayor would be dead if john didnt show up?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">oh yes absolutely</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">he would be burnt to a crisp right now i am sure of it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: god damn jade</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: why would you do that you know eventually id probably start using my powers and reluctantly start embracing my role as a reluctant hero</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: that shit always happens</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">no you wouldnt you were just going to argue with me forever!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: yeah maybe</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but the point is youre not going to bother killing the mayor anymore are you</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">i guess not</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">he is a very cute mayor after all</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: see john your fake time travel shit is already paying off</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: you saved the mayor congratulations</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: ok, i'm glad the mayor is alive and well.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but this is exactly what i wanted to avoid!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: isn't there some way you could just...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: pretend i never showed up, and let this play out the way it was supposed to?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">sorry john</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">whatever dave and i were going to argue about</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">i think the moment has passed</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">JADE:</span> <span style=\"color: #000000\">the whole thing is kind of ruined to be honest</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: DAMN IT!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: ok all yall settle down im getting a text</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: ...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: i cant fucking read this</p>",
