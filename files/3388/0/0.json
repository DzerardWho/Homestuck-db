And how I wish you could have been my son. You were so much better than that traitorous piece of shit Cal who betrayed me to join Hook. \r<br/> <br/>You taught me so much, Rufio. You taught me to crow. You taught me to fight. You taught me to fly. Please don't teach me to die now. I know no one thought you were real. But I believed in you. I always believed.
