I just want to get started!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: That's the most awesome way to be, Jane.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: And it is again why you will be our leader.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: (Sort of.)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Right.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Still fixing to pull the strings for us, per your extensive puppet metaphor?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Pulling them as we speak.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I am having Lil Seb install a real copy of the client on another computer in your house.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: A clean computer, not any of this BCCorp garbage you tend to accumulate.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I'll have to insist from this point onward, you employ neutral devices.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: That shit fucks with your head.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Hrm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Alrighty, I think I can make that concession.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Once it's installed, I'll connect with you. I will be your server player.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: I know this isn't what you were hoping for, but some improvisation is in order.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: While you get the ball rolling, I'll try to talk some sense into that mercurial boozehound.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Sounds like a plan.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I do hope she comes around. It would be a bummer to play without her.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: She will.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Say, do I even have any machines that survived the explosion besides this one?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: Do you even have any machines that don't inundate you with fucking Hamburger Helper ads and Guy Fieri's heinous propaganda?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I guess not. :p</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Still, some nice things were surely destroyed.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: I think Detective Pony was caught in the blast.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: It's unlikely Acorn survived. :'(</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: A fitting end to a life of moral compromise.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: So, since I'm apparently out of \"neutral devices,\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: #00d5f2\">GG: Which computer is Seb installing the file on?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: On your dad's computer downstairs.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: One in the study.</p>",
