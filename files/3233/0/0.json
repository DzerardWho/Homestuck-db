She is the model of grace and beauty. I am always a bit flustered in her presence, especially when she carries her little pail around like that.\r<br/> <br/>Whereas THIS lazy sack of crap here makes me sick to my stomach.\r<br/> <br/>Cal, God damn it. We were all supposed to dress up for this. It doesn't look like you even touched that nice suit I sewed for you, let alone swapped your eyes with those billiard balls and make them alternate rapidly.\r<br/> <br/>This insubordination is putting me in a foul mood. It's bad enough I just had to take Falcor out behind the woodshed and blow his brains out after he caught the rabies.</p>",
