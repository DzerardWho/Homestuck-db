He will grow up an orphan, just like you.\r<br/> <br/>This adult alien male appears to be taking on the role of his custodian, instead of killing the boy outright. What a fascinating culture. \r<br/> <br/>The fellow retrieves the lusus carcass. This appears to be a gentleman who knows better than to let good pony meat go to waste.</p>",
