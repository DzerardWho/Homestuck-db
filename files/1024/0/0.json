Because of the all the strange drawings in your room?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: A father then embraces a son's hobby to establish a stronger bond.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Or wages a campaign of passive-aggresive mockery of your interests.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: Either is plausible. I don't know your dad that well.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i dunno.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: not sure about all this.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: but i think we need to stop and acknowledge the bunny sassacre fedora i just made.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: It's awesome.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: yeah.</p>",
