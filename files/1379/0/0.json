It is not a tangible item, and can never be used ever. It seems to be more of an imprint on the card itself, like a watermark.\r<br/> <br/>However, the back of the card does seem to contain a viable CAPTCHA CODE for a real DUTTON PHOTO, for whatever it's worth.\r<br/> <br/>Which is very little.</p>",
