And even so, he didn't have the patience to w8. Unfortun8tely for everyone to ever exist, he discovered a way to predomin8te early. Yet it was not this act alone that would prove ominous, so much as the means through which it was achieved. He was allowed to 8ecome the solo player of a game which his kind was never meant to play.\n\nAnd so, it is with the predomin8tion of her son that our heroine's story ends, and the story of our villain 8egins.</p>",
