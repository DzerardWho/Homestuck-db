Why did you want to go?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: because i made the map so i know how to get there better</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: But it seems simple enough. A set of bearings to follow.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: See? The application pilots the moon. Change course when necessary. Anyone can do it, really.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: We talked about this. Debated, if you recall.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: ok if you remember it all so clearly why are you grilling me on this shit</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: will you just tell me whats going on</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I'm just seeing if you can remember. And if you're sticking to your story, about why you should be the one to go.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: well i am</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: because i should</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: or should have</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: man what the fuck is going on</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: am i dead or are you dead or what</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: You're almost there, really. Just try to remember a little more.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: What happened after we decided you'd go?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: uh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: oh yeah</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: we were trying to figure out a way to detach the moon</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: so i could pilot it out there</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: fly it into the sun</p>",
