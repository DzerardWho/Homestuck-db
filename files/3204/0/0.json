dave you have to make sure that doesnt happen!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: it wasnt a future dave he was from a while ago</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: oh</p>\n<p style=\"color:

style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: i was swindled into splitting time paths along the way and that guy got the dead end of the stick</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: ill be fine</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: ok...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i am still not sure i get that!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: but i guess i am relieved?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: yes you

die?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: was it jack?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: yeah</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: hes pretty much the guy in charge of random teleportation murders right now</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: D:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: what about your...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: um....</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: oh no i dont even know if you know about this</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: what</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: my bro</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: yeah jack killed him too</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: ;_;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: is it something you would like to talk about</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: not much to talk about</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: this is some pretty serious existence threatening shit going down and some people are going to die i guess</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: even crazy hard dudes like my bro slash weird covert biological ghost dad</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: ghost dad???</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: yeah roses too</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: i thought john filled you in on the ectobiology stuff</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: oh...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: yes he mentioned something about it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i guess i didnt realize its full implications....</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: but time was short when we talked!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: bottom line is were all related slimewise except you and me and him and rose pairways respectively</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: makes the shipping chart pretty simple here hang on while i dig up that piece of shit karkat made</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: where the fuck did that thing go</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: fuck it never mind</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: just imagine something ugly made by a jackass</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: ugh i forgot i still have to get back to him</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: its like a big unpleasant chore hanging over my head D:</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: i guess</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: anyway dave im really sorry about your bro/dad</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: you were pretty close with him right?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: meh it was a pretty bizarre relationship by any standard</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: fightin off wave after wave of face pumicing puppet ass every day</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: always being on guard for stealth attacks in the middle of the night while getting up to go to the fucking bathroom</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: heheh</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: but i guess it all sorta amounted to some vague unspoken semblance of kinship</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: if thats a thing</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: like if honor among thieves is something then lets call it camaraderie among ironic rapping roof ninjas</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: but thanks</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: sure</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: i thought about taking his sword</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: when i was there</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: but i couldnt</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: couldnt really bring myself to try to pull it out it was too weird</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: dave we have to stop him!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: what</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: jack!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: he shouldnt get away with this</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: you think</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: yes</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: why dont you stop jumping around through time like a maniac and stop being like a hundred daves all the time and come to my house so we can make a plan to kill him??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: well id like to</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: but im still trapped in the chronologistics of this fuckin one man ballet</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: there are loops outstanding and if i step out of line you get to see more bloody daves</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: im getting pretty sick of it but i think itll be over soon</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: then ill break out and ride linear the rest of the way i think</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: once its time to put the end game in motion</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: til then youre on your own for a while</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: oh :(</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: besides we cant beat him</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: look what he did to bro and davesprite together</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: im at the top of my echeladder with all the fraymotifs and i stand no chance</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: johns even better than that even though he doesnt know it at the moment</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: and he stands no chance either</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: only thing we can do is hold out until the scratch</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: what is the scratch?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: guess i shouldnt really say</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: since you sort of lead the way in making that plan</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: really??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: yeah well</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: suffice to say</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: if we cant beat him</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: all we can really do is exile him to a place where he cant teleport back</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: which hopefully buys us some time</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: to try to take out his power source in a crazy suicide mission</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: hmmmm...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: so was that like a hint?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: about what im supposed to do :D</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: kinda</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: well maybe im just being naive...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: but a crazy suicide mission does not sound like the ideal solution to me!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: are you suuuure we cant beat him?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #4ac925\">GG: i dont know if we should rule it out!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: well</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: youre about to do what youre about to do</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: and im not going to tell you not to</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: i wont do the bullshit troll thing and tell you what youre going to do and then just dare you not to</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: while knowing damn well you will anyway</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: so ill just say</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: whats next is up to you</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: and if later you want to talk about it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">TG: im here</p>\n<p
