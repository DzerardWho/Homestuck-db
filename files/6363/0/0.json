What power?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: it's not a god tier power.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: it's something else. something i got when i stuck my hand in a magic thing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: A magic thing?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: um, that's a long story.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: one involving pirates.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: Pirates??</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i said it's a long story!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: anyway, when i put my hand in the thing...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i became all... blurry.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: Blurry.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: yes.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: and i kept randomly getting blurry and disappearing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: and now i think i'm sort of unstuck in existence.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: like i'm not fully a part of reality anymore, or bound by the rules governing it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: ...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: man, i'm doing a terrible job explaining this.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: ok, the bottom line is, now i just randomly disappear sometimes!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: and i reappear somewhere else in time and space.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but it's not really like normal time travel.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: at least, i don't think so.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: with regular time travel, the rules are pretty strict.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: either paradox space already accounted for your time traveling, and you were always supposed to do it all along...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: or you messed up, and changed something you weren't supposed to. in which case you just made a bad timeline, and everyone dies or something. right?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: Sure.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but this isn't like that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i'm not sure how i know, but it feels like these jumps are totally outside all those rules.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: when i jump somewhere, like in the past...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i think i can actually change stuff that isn't supposed to be changed.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: which makes me kinda nervous!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: Hmm.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: Can you demonstrate this ability?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: not really.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i mean, not intentionally.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i can't seem to control the jumps.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: maybe that's for the best though.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: if i could control it, and tried to use it to my advantage, i would probably just make a huge mess of things.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #008282\">TEREZI: Y3S, YOU WOULD</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: Even so, it will be worth noting if you're able to refine the ability.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: Could you please keep me informed of any developments?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: yeah!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: And while you're at it, maybe you could tell us exactly what happened just after we arrived.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: ummmm...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: well, we were all pretty confused at first.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: you all just appeared out of nowhere, and started babbling about evil jade.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: you asked me what happened, but i didn't know anything because i just got there myself, and was all alone.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but then it was cool, we all just walked around the land of hills and stone henges, or whatever it's called, and caught up a bit on the last three years.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: we were trying to figure out what to do, and decided it would be a good idea to try and meet up with all the new kids.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but we had no idea where they were.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: and i still don't, except i have since determined that my teen nanna is evil too.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but she is more like an evil robot than a scary wolf girl. um, but i digress.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: so we were planning to make some scouting expeditions to the new planets to look for them, and everything was fine.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: that is, until evil jade showed up.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: she made you all disappear again, and then came after me, but i used my windy powers to evade her, which really pissed her off!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: so she beat the crap out of me. :(</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: but then i randomly zapped away, and have been running from her ever since.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: i am swishing the breeze around like crazy to throw her off my trail, but she keeps finding me.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: she's so crafty!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: That's good.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: We need you out there if we're going to stand a chance of accomplishing anything.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: I agree with our prior conclusions. Finding the other players is imperative.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: Given the current state of the session, I would not be surprised if they are all prisoners as well.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: Do you think you can find them?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: yes, i can try.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: what should i do when i find them?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: ...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: That's a good question.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: heheh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: First, I guess just tell them,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: We're here.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: alright.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: I don't know. We'll figure something out.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: if i see your mom, is there anything you want me to tell her?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: My mom?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">JOHN: yes. i mean, your kid mom, obviously.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: I know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: Uh,</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: Wow.</p>",
