idea exciting.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: I know I'm looking forward to it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: but your mom was just a nice alcoholic spinster who liked wizards who you complained about for no reason</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: she wasnt anything like an untouchable master of irony who could replace the meat in your sandwich before it even occurred to you what the fuck you were chewing</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: let me ask you this did your mom ever wiggle a puppet in your face even ONCE</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: Not that I recall.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #b536da\">ROSE: But anecdotes like that just make me more curious to meet him, personally.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: fine well you can be on bro duty then</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: ill be the ambassador to your mom</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: and no that wasnt actually meant as the sick burn it sounded like</p>\n<p

wagon for the john and jade teen old people and also our mom thats the plan</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: so when we finally see them we can get our shit into formation like trained acrobats</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: like ill blow a whistle and we make a human pyramid got it</p>\n<p style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: that way we can totally avoid anything awkward</p>\n<p
