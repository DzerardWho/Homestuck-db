It's not just a8out glory you know.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ecause if I don't do it, then who will?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: well, we have a plan to defeat him too, so there's that.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Yes, I know a8out your plan.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I guess two plans are 8etter than one, right?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: yeah.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: so...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: will you go fight him then?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Man, I don't know anymore.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: It's one reason I'm freaking out a8out this. A8out feeling 8ad a8out a simple, perfectly justifia8le killing.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: If I can't handle that, doesn't it mean I'm not as strong as I thought? What hope do I have against Jack if that's the case?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: for whatever it's worth coming from a human, feeling remorse doesn't make you weak!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: i bet you are still really strong.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: but then, i'm not sure if i actually want to encourage you to go off fighting him...</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: because as strong as you probably are, it sounds like he is REALLY strong.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: and even though you killed tons of people, i think i would still be pretty sad if you died.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Aw. ::::)</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: so maybe you should just let us handle it? at least we won't fight him directly.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I don't know. Even though I'm conflicted, it still feels like something I have to do.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: I admit, I'm pretty scared thinking a8out it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Not of him necessarily, 8ut of the fact that I apparently don't know myself as well as I 8elieved.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: What if I'm not as lucky as I thought?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: What if I do not in fact have ALLLLLLLL of the luck?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: well, maybe you don't?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: all of the luck sounds like an awful lot of luck to have.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Exactly!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: 8ut then, if there is no chance of catching a 8ad 8r8k, then taking a risk doesn't even qualify as 8r8very, does it?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: It isn't even a risk, 8y definition!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: So if this is going to mean anything, I guess I just have to find the strength from somewhere to go through with it.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: More than just the fakey strength that comes from turning a 8lind eye to all your flaws. You know what I mean?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: heh.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #005682\">AG: Hmm........</p>\n<p style=\"color: #0715cd\">EB: what?</p>",
