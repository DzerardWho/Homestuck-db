That I'd be the functional leader of our party.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: And there might have been something to that, in a different session.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: But what good is a \"man of action\" in a place where action itself is intrinsically fruitless?</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: So it's occurred to me that by some tragic flaw in its design, our session was meant to be leaderless.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #f2a400\">TT: And I'd feel safe concluding that. Except for a feeling that's been gnawing at me.</p>",
