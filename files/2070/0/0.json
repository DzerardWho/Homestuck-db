After a lot of kicking and fussing and gnashing of teeth and carapace, you just pull out a few CHILLED ROE CUBES from the fridge to settle the beast down.\r<br/> <br/>Trolls and their custodians have a peculiar arrangement of codependence. The lusus behaves as a lifelong bodyguard, caretaker, and visceral sort of mentor, while the young troll must learn to function as a sort of zookeeper.\r<br/> <br/>We decide to agree this conflict is not a big enough deal to warrant a detailed examination of the action, or an embedded musical accompaniment. We also agree that while that would have been pretty sweet, we are also in kind of a hurry here. But if it were to be accompanied by something audible, <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"/images/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/showdown.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">it would probably sound something like this</a>. We decide to listen to that track, close our eyes, and imagine what might have been.\r<br/> <br/>Wow that sure was awesome.\r<br/> <br/>Anyway, moving on.</p>",
