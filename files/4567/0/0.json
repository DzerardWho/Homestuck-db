Your bro blocked the door ages ago with this totally pimp stone bust. You give CAPTAIN SNOOP a little nod of approval every time you walk by to go to the bathroom. You like to think he nods back in a way that is so smooth and so subtle, he literally doesn't move at all.\r<br/> <br/>The thing is too heavy to move out of the way, and in any case you don't really want to. You just use a different exit to your room.</p>",
